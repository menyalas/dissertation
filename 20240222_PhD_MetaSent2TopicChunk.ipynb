       "\"TRINIDAD On Train from Steubenville, Ohio, to Cincinnati. Nov 30, 1872. My Darling Sister Justina: How interestedly you, Sister M Louis and myself read Eugénie de Guérin's Journal and her daily anxieties to save her brother from being a spiritual outcast! This Journal which I propose keeping for you will deal with incidents occurring on my journey to Trinidad and happenings in that far-off land to which I am consigned. The Journal will begin with the first act. Here is Mother Josephine's letter: Mt St Vincent, O, Nov 27, 1872. Sister Blandina, Steubenville, O My Dear Child: You are missioned to Trinidad. You will leave Cincinnati Wednesday and alone. Mother Regina will attend to your needs. Devotedly, Mother Josephine. This letter thrilled us both. I was delighted to make the sacrifice, and you were hiding your feelings that I might not lose any merit. Neither of us could find Trinidad on the map except in the island of Cuba. So we concluded that Cuba was my destination. I was to leave Steubenville quietly so that none of my obstreperous pupils might cause the incoming teacher\""

My Darling Sister Justina: How interestedly you, Sister M Louis and myself read Eugénie de Guérin's Journal and her daily anxieties to save her brother from being a spiritual outcast! This Journal which I propose keeping for you will deal with incidents occurring on my journey to Trinidad and happenings in that far-off land to which I am consigned. The Journal will begin with the first act. Here is Mother Josephine's letter: Mt St Vincent, O, Nov 27, 1872. Sister Blandina, Steubenville, O My Dear Child: You are missioned to Trinidad. You will leave Cincinnati Wednesday and alone. Mother Regina will attend to your needs. Devotedly, Mother Josephine. This letter thrilled us both. I was delighted to make the sacrifice, and you were hiding your feelings that I might not lose any merit. Neither of us could find Trinidad on the map except in the island of Cuba. So we concluded that Cuba was my destination. I was to leave Steubenville quietly so that none of my obstreperous pupils might cause the incoming teacher\": 12}"
