      "Charra Wednesday Nov 4th 1883 A nice cool day Mrs Roberts and I were talking nearly the whole night feel very tired today Tom left just after breakfast for Mr Hiern's Station he will not be back until Sunday or Monday he is talking of going out to the new Tanks over 100 miles from here if he can make sure of getting water I Darned up the socks and Stockings I had with me and cut out some under clothes. Charra Thursday Nov 8th North wind first thing this morning with heavy thunder but only a few drops of rain I was so sleepy did not get up till very late had been hand sewing which is very tiresome My throat keep very sore still the Cold has not nearly left one Worrier ill with cold our Black Boy Charra Friday Nov 9th We have had thunder and lightning with a little rain off and on all day I have been sewing all day but Mrs Roberts keeps me talking after going to bed till all hours of the night so that I can't get up in the morning have had a head ache all day from want of rest and sitting too close. Young Jeff Miller and Jimmy Roberts here tonight they are on the road to Mercaney with sheep what a torment Mrs Roberts is to the Children she rubbed grease on a plate then smoked it black over a Candle and marked the Boys faces after they were asleep drinking so much tea kills me I must leave it off Charra Saturday nov 10th We had more rain and thunder this morning I was late up again Mrs Roberts will think me a sleepy head the breakfast was over when I came out the Boys were away and Mr Roberts just leaving Mrs Roberts and the girls Cleaning and Cooking I was sewing We were just in the middle of a fine old gossip when Frank was seen coming with two Police horses one packed with Toms uniform he has to go to Venus Bay for Drill by the sixteenth of the month which is next Friday Frank did not arrive till 2P.M so after he had some dinner I thought it best to come on to Denial Bay if we did not meet Tom coming to Charra and wait till Sunday morning feeling sure we should meet him about 10am at Denial Bay it was after three P.M. when we started and had 26 miles to travel over heavy sand for some miles the last part of the Journey and by the sea coast. it was quite dark when we reached the Tanks we were all very cold the Boys watered and turned out the horses lit the fire boiled the quart pots and made tea I had no appetite feeling worried for I feared the mare would not bring us on she looked so bad then we made a bed under the shed of bags of Chaff which belong to the government Frank lay down by my side we did not undress. I did not take off my boots the Boys slept well but I did not had flatulence and palpatation very badly I think taking a little Brandy on coming to Camp caused it. Mrs Roberts lent me two pairs of Blankets but felt very cold towards morning she kindly gave us all we required for the journey Denial Bay Sunday Nov 11th We had a few light showers of rain during the night the Weather looks heavy with rain and thunder Clouds today the mail passed this morning with Langley and Albert Campbell as driver they were driving four horses I went for a walk and met Mr William Hasken also walking he with his brother Sailed over from St Peters Island yesterday for their mail his mother and Sisters are in Adelaide have been waiting for Tom till noon then wrote a note and sent Worrier on Jester to Mercaney as Langley told me a Black Boy going to Mr Watsons yesterday from Mr Hierns place told him Tom was at Mercaney and intended to meet the mail at Laura Bay today which is fifteen miles nearer Streaky Bay and six miles out of his road coming home which I can't understand but hope to know tonight all about it. Wish I had sent early this morning can't think why he is staying so long about Mercaney I hope he is not drinking feel very anxious I am very anxious can't eat and my heart is beating fast. such a cold morning we all had a walk along the beach but the tide was high saw Mr Hoskin and his Tent camp back to camp had dinner wrote a note to Tom and sent Worrier to Mercaney with it on Jester. Frank and I walked to the Beach gathered winkels then back to Tanks and along the Mercaney road walked till we were tired came back to camp was just making a quart of tea when Tom and Worrier came he was not coming back for several days had he not been sent for but was then just going out to the Tanks in the Desert with Mr Hiern on the Camels he could not get out with horses no water in tanks and no grass he had been helping Mr Hiern to load his stores Friday and Saturday at Laura Bay. the Boys made a wurley in the scrub for Tom and I and one for themselves I grilled the Chops the two Hoskins joined us at supper. Denial Bay Monday Nov 12th Up early the two Hoskins. Jeff Miller Jimmy Roberts Frank Worrier Tom and I all camped here Denial Bay I got breakfast Tom and Boys Harnessed and saddled horses here we had to part I could not go through with Tom to Streaky Bay the mare was far too weak and her Collar was not large enough for his horses necks so he could not help me without injury to his Police horses had the road down been good I might have managed but it is a heavy drag the whole way after one leaves Denial Bay nothing but sand so Tom left for S.B. Frank and I for Charra. We had 26 miles to travel the old mare would walk along and pull but did not care to trot we got to Charra about 1.P.M.

(Charra) Tuesday Nov 13th Weather heavy and showery till 11.A.M.

My Father too I can see is taking her part so I have a pleasant life with one thing and another If what I see from day to day amongst people professing religion and expecting when they die to be taken unto god to sit at his right hand at the last day then there surely must be a corner left for such as I.

sewing We were just in the middle of a fine old gossip when Frank was seen coming with two Police horses one packed with Toms uniform he has to go to Venus Bay for Drill by the sixteenth of the month which is next Friday Frank did not arrive till 2PM so after he had some dinner I thought it best to come on to Denial Bay if we did not meet Tom coming to Charra and wait till Sunday morning feeling sure we should meet him about 10am at Denial Bay it was after three PM when we started and had 26 miles to travel over heavy sand for some miles the last part of the Journey and by the sea coast it was quite dark when we reached the Tanks we were all very cold the Boys watered and turned out the horses lit the fire boiled the quart pots and made tea I had no appetite feeling worried for I feared the mare would not bring us on she looked so bad then we made a bed under the shed of bags of Chaff which belong to the government Frank lay down by my side we did not undress I did not take off my boots the Boys slept well but I did not had flatulence and palpatation very badly I think taking a little Brandy on coming to Camp caused it Mrs Roberts lent me two pairs of Blankets but felt very cold towards morning she kindly gave us all we required for the journey Denial Bay Sunday Nov 11th We had a few light showers of rain during the night the Weather looks heavy with rain and thunder Clouds today the mail passed this morning with Langley and Albert Campbell as driver they were driving four horses I went for a walk and met Mr William Hasken also walking he with his brother Sailed

       "\"Edith Gwynne July 14 71 Glynde Place July 17 Black Monday Julia left us this morning with the intention of going home Willie returned from Poll's went to school. The glass stands at much rain I have now three broods of turkeys one of 9 one of 7 and one of 4. Also two hens sitting on eleven eggs each they commenced to us on the 13 Mr Furguson's wedding day. July 19 A nasty cold rainy day. Losses still continue among the turkeys. I sat a turkey on 13 ducks eggs and a hen on 7 so altogether I have about 44 eggs in the process of hatching July 20 Polly came in the morning to stay sill to worr as she is not going to the ball at Government House on account of not being well. I walk up to the lore meet Emily Bakewell. she is rather disappointed not to go the ball to night Very cold and turkies dying daily July 21 I do a little painting in my crest Album and then we all turn out for a walk to pick up oranges. Polly goes home taking queeny with her. Heyne sends some plants for Papa among them the Mountain Ash I show the boy where to put them. And Turkeys are now reduces to 21. Teddy came home and does not seem to have much to tell about the ball Mr Fargupon and his bride where there she in her wedding dress. Little Sally Searl started for mount Lofty on her first visit home and the Children are rather troublesome Have down the small furnace for warming the turkies house I hope they will prosper better Wrote to Nellie Beld to say I should not be able to come to her reading to morrow. E C Pyine July 22 We go to town in the morning I get some embroydery to make me some collers. We see Ellen Hate Anne and Aunt Sarah in town and I see Mr Green make myself a collar in the afternoon Walk up to the store to get the papers and find Howland has taken them. EC Gwynne July 23 Sunday Feddy and Now walk to the college to church but I stay at home to mind the children Sarah Tulstone and I take the little ones down to the river and then pay Mr Turner a visit. Get home a short time before dinner and have a very fine turkey about which Papa makes geat fun saying he is sure If Ledd had known what was for dinner he would not have stayed away I commence Fallen Moon I think it very beatiful but not equal as far as my judgement goes to some of Byrons Perhaps the wording is more beatiful but it is not spirited nor has it such bursts of power as are found generally at the commenc ment of Lord B pieces July 24 A nice fine morning we have dinner early I start in the buggy to call on Mrs Scott but before we reach town the rain comes down in torrents and we have to make for the Court House we stay there some time till the rain stops a little and then come home feeling ashamed and cross It is always the way when the Gwynnes do anything so unusual as calling they are sure to get wet. Mr Downer comes to ask permission to tunnel through our grounds and it is arranged they are to go through Davis'. Mr Downer stays late and talks bursiness with Papa so Mama and I have to go into the nursery. A disagreeable thing occurs while we are away. Mary the cook accused Sarah Fulstone of stealing and finds several things she has taken in her bag. EC Gwynne July 25 Rains again to day I pick and arrange one of the lovliest bunches of flowers I ever saw. We are busy all the morning making sausages. I read my french book. Mr Lucas come in with Leddy he comes to ask for wood as they had unluckily run short of it. Papa sends over a load. July 29 I went round to North Adelaide in the buggy and get Nell Fanny is busy dressing to have her likeness taken I do the Saturday shopping and come home. Go out in the paddock to see the event we see them take two fences and there are two falls. We walk home by the Glynde I see Mr Loey and the Leans Mr Lucas and Bacon come and eat game supper with us it is rather fun but I get very tired towards the end as they stayed till twelve July 30 Sunday Teddy walks to church and does not make his appearance again to day Rowland Ellen and I go for a walk to see if we can shoot a crane we do not see any. Ellen tries to pass a place in the creek which is too wide for her and she stumbles in and gets all her clothes wet up to her knees We then go and look at the wood that is being cut up. I have a shot with the gun which seems to me very much like an eletric shock must be. A great bump on the shoulder a swimming in the head a ears I I have shot a tree at the dissance of 30 yards it was the first time I ever fired a cun. Mr Acraman and Lotty came down to dinner. Mr Bakewells Leonard and Buston come to take us out for a walk but then stay so long that we have very little time for walking. We just go and look a the jumps the the Henders had taken and then part with our friends and come in tor tea July 31 Mama goes in to town a makes extensive purchases for the children books for Dick and Leedys and a hat for the latter a piece of silk to make me an apron I make a lemon pudding for the first time and it is a great success. Aug 3 I have a very bad cold mama goes to town with Papa in the morning and does not return till five she goes to see Mrs Acraman for the first time since she has been in her new house mama brings home two plants one a nice-paper plant. When Manna gets home my cold has become so bad that I am obliged to go to bed have two plaisters on my chest and some medicine. Aug 4 I am so exausted after my doctering last night that I do not get up till one o'clock I finish a pinafore for Codgie and put in on her and she is very pleased We have been having the most lovely weather the last week some times perfectly cloudless skies Dick has caught no less than 23 Waxbils with in the last three days. It is not strange he had no decoy birds to catch them with only the cage set and food in it. Mrs Philipson and Mrs Leve came to call on us. They all seemed. very merry and wished us to come over as see them Mr Philipson had this morning bitten the tails of three poor little dogs only fancy what a hog! Things seem a little cross at Glynde to day Teddy is not in a good temper Papa not well and we are still with out a house-maid one came to speek to Mama to day And 6 I was too unwell to go to town so Mama went and Dick took the decoy cage but he could not find any sale for the birds. I go out for a walk I partly finish Codgies pinafore Aug 6 Teddy started at seven in the morning for Port Gawler on a shooting expedition with Mr. Bacon I got out of bed and looked through the window to see him go. Polly and Mr Knox came to dinner I did not feel well I read Fallen Brook all the morning. I give Polly some plants and we take an evening walk. Codgie has a very bad cold. Aug 7 The Duke of Edinburgh birthday a public holiday Bill Sharts of pleasure intent spends a day in town and rather an uncomfortable one too The weather is beautifully fine in the early part of the day and very stormy towards the afternoon and sharp showers Kow goes out on horse back to frig and see a little life and gets a good deal of rain. Mr Seatre and his son come down to call he is a most extrodinary man I ever saw but his son is a nice boy. Mr Lecke asked Acy who was an undtidy little sight at the time who is your barber and who mends you trousers. which of course are showing two naked knew. Mama takes him. Loud in garden and I stay in and am just working quietly by the fire when I hear a rushing of feet and such a thundering and the door by some chance it has got shut I rush and let them in when Mr Leeke throws orange peel on the door step and then with his wet muddy boots kicks it off. The running was caused by a sharp shower which came on suddenly whilst they were in the garden. Altogether Papa's friend seems rather a blustering awquard sorts of a person. I go for a walk down the drive. We hear a report that one of Mr Smith's sons is drowned while holiday keeping at the Port. Teddy came home at about twelve after we are all in bed Aug 8 I Mama and Acy go for a walk down the drive first thing after Papa has gone to town. it is so lovely after the rain which came down in earnest last night Teddy brought home some nice game. Two rabbits and Wood goose two moored hens and a Plover Which I go out to see in black fellow dress a rug wraped round my nightdress. We hear that it is true about young Smith. He was a young fellow about twenty two was out boating with three companions when the boat upset and two of them were unable to swim they managed to cling to the boat for some time till all but Mr Smith was knocked off several times and replaced by his companion at last sunk. the other three were picked up by a small. steamer. What a fearful shock it must be to his parents and his poor companions who had to go and tell his father. He said Thank you and walked away. I think if I were any relation of his I would rather die then face it out. Only imagine the lidcous sorrow really should long to die Aug 10 We have our game supper Jock comes and Mr Lucas but Mr Bacon cannot as they have no servants and he can't leave Mrs Bacon. The rabbits were pronounced delicious Aug 12 I went to town for Mama Went to Turnip 11 and got Kate Ellen and Mrs Barris In the afternoon we all walked down to the river and then a long way past Mr Mildreds I felt very tored when we got ghome.

In fact is quite kittenish. We go back to Mrs Scotts to tea and have a little music. Mr and Mrs Scott present Louisa with a beautiful gold brooch set with pearls and emeralds which of course is much admired. The wild flowers are so splendid all in profuse bloom and Mr Turnbull is most asbensive in gathering them for Emily. It is quite dusk in side the omnibus and the conversa- tion is rather lame in fact I am not sure that some of the grown up people as will as bothe the children were not asleep. The omnibus brings me as far as the gate and Mr Way and VE Logan are both offering to bring me home but I refuse and run off in the midst of the offers and come up the drive very quickly a gun goes of bang and gives me rather a start It is beatiful a cool in the drive running and I reach the Hall door and so ends the bridesmaids picnic and a pleasant day altogether is was Oct 1 Sunday. Row come to my door in the morning and asks if we should like to go to church. We say not and spend the morning wandering about the garden Leddy and Row walk to the College and bring Mr Jay home with them to dinner The boys all go out for a walk and we stay a discuss what will be a fair price for the dresses to be done at Palmers. Tanny and I walk part of the way home with Aunt Sarah who is obliged to go home Mt Jay is very nice and tells a good deal of news laughs at the fact of Mr C Harlly who has seven hundred a year (so report says) having not less than One hundred and fifty ladies married and single to call on his mother in one day Oct 2 I go up to town and meet the Bakes and other bride maids at Palmers. We are three mortal hours deciding about the dresses so long that Pape goes home without me. But I meet Polly and she gives me a drive home. Dick comes nome and is to go to school tomorrow. Oct 3 Mama takes Dick up to Mrs Ransays for the first timed says he looked rather afraid when she left him Pape Mama and the little ones go out to cheer Dick on the first return from school I am busy all day straining Curacoa and feel quite tired at five o'clock when it is finished. Ellen comes home by the omnibus and we all go to the Opera in the evening. Which is very grand the best managed scenery I ever saw more effective and complicated than I have seen on the Adelaid stage. Oct 4 Ellen goes back to school. I put in my geranium cutting work as a chinese I have on hand and then come over here to write. Mama goes up to the cellar to help Row and to taste wine Oct 5 I went for a walk by the river it looked so lovely the willows are all in beatiful leaf now. And I sat by the side of the bubbling waters under the weeping willow trees for a lone time playing with the little pebbles of all colours. I love to be quite alone by the river side of an evenings to think of what I please. The effect of romancing by the river is an increase of cold Mr Way sent me tothaire by Teddy so I read it in the evening Oct 6 Papa Mama Row and I go to town in the morning. I buy a pair stockings and white gloves for the wedding I walk down to see Louisa and find the Hawkeys have arrived Gerdy has grown such an old fashoned little thing and so friendly I stay and talk for a hour or two and see several hansom presents and Louisa had received. Mrs Hawkey was very amusing and pretended to be very out of the world Aunt Sarah is to go in with Leonard which I hardly think satisfactory to either parties and Teddy is to have Mrs. Williams. I do so hope the evening party will be a success I have tried with flowers three times different things about the party and then have always come right. Oct 7 It is the strangest Saturday I have known for some time not going to town makes it so. I am now going to read for an hour and after that fate alone can say. I have four ducks hatched and six turkeys one of which is already dead. We go up to call at Mr Davenports. Mr and Mrs Hawkes are there and altogether we have a pleasant visit. Papa and Mama were very delighted with some white wine and Papa made great fun coming home and declared he was obliged to hold mama in the buggy coming home. The wine certainly was very strong for Mamas cheeks were so red and her eyes so bright although she only had half a glass. Found one of my little quacks dead when we got home Oct 8 Sunday. The boys drive me to church Fanny and Mr W Warburton come home with us Mr Warbuton seems so altered since I saw him last nicer I think. Mr and Mrs Lucas look down in the course of the afternoon and We all go round the garden. Fanny and I go with Dick to put his mare and its baby foal in the paddock. Rowland goes off directly after dinner and we do not see him till bed time. Mr Warburton will go home it is so far to walk but he is very firm as he had promised Oct 9 Every day now draws nearer to Louisas wedding Fanny goes home this This morning we just catch the Bakers buggy and they give Fan a ride I have been busy washing lace on a bobble to wear to the Opera this evening. Aunt Charlotte is under a hold promise to go with us this evening but I do not expect her a bit. Aunt Charlotte turns up all right and looks very well Martha is one if not the best opera I have seen Oct 10 Papa goes to town I have a great mind to go with him to see about some things to wear on Thursday but it is so close that I almost make up my mind to do without them Papa is not home till late. Oct 11 I go up to town with Papa buy a supply of black velvet and a pair of orange boot. I think to come out by the early omnibus but miss it by about half a hour so have a long time to dis- pose of go round to the Institute and read the Village on the Cliffs seated on the stairs leading to the museum and every body passing stared at me as it I were part of the collection of couriosities. Get home just before lunch and find a note from Louisa and a pretty silver thing for holding a button hole. The present from Mr Gurner to his bridesmaids. So I have to write and thank him. Louisa sends the boy up for flowers I send some beatiful roses and lot of green down. Mama William Dick and Molly go to the Opera the little ones seem particularly pleased especially Molly who seemed to understand a great part of what she had heard. Oct 12 A red letter day At least so I should think as it is the wedding day of my only true girl friend I get up early a go for a walk all round the garden before breakfast and pick some blue bells to wear in my dress to day. Am scarcely dressed when the carriage comes to the door and Papa is very fussed quite unnecessarily as it was too early by half a hour for the appointed time. Miss Leake and I have the carriege to our selves as far as town where we pick up Miss Ayers and from their house we go to the church. Some strange old creature in black comes up and begins to talk to Miss Leake. And from what I could catch the proclaimed herself some relation to Mr Russell and that she was a scotch morneen and passing by heard there was a wedding and had asked who the bonnie lassie was. And a lot more that I could not hear. But this strange old creature among us all in blue and white and at a wedding produced a romantic turn of mind and the uncaught gibberish she was pronouncing seem to me prophectic and witch like. But soon the bride arrived and all was forgetten. Louisa seem very nervous her hands shook and the perfect white and maidenhair bouquet shook allso. The marriage was as very imposing ceremony so the lookers on told me but we could not see much. The church was very full and beutifully decorated with bunches of flowers and greens. Emily and Mr Turnbull and Mr Way all came home in one carrige. The breakfast went off nobly not a tear and a good deal of speachifying Mr Peacocks being the best. At about three the guests bride and bridegroom nens away Louisa look very nice although her dress was a little homely for a bride and then the guests did likewise. Aunt Sarah and I walked home to rest for the evening I feel so dreadfully tired I can scarcely stand lay down on my bed and read the Village on the Cliffs the fate of poor little Catherine and her unhappy love affair finds sbeaege sympathy in me and I cry so I am obliged to leave off reading and try to rest. Go in to the dining wak I have tea I then it is time to dress. I feel so unwell that I ought not to go but I would not miss it for any thing. I take a pick me up and feel much better. We have rather a nice party in the evening. Mr Green is there and he is cruel enough not to ask me to dance once. I am introduced to Mr Walsh he is rather nice Aunt Sarah cannot stand the fatigue I look dreadful Ice who is fresh looked very nice. Mrs Williams is the Bell of the ball in more senses than one. I feel much fresher as the evening gets on. We dance till three oclock and even then the boys do not seem to wish to come away. Mr Saville and several other of the gentleman were rather excited toward the end of the evening the day was all the bride could have desired bright and cool. Oct 13 the little stone plunged in the great ocean has sunk and even the ripple is scarcely visible so soon to things human pass away But yester Louisa was married the long looked forward to Thursday the 12th come and gone and almost forgotten. Polly stayes the night with us after the party and drove hiamer out to call on Mrs. Acraman this afternoon but she had just gone for a drive. I take a rest a then come over here to write. Oct 14 A very wet day Mama Willie and I go to town and order the things at Crawfords and then we drive round to North Adelaide to get Ellen. Aimee and Kate walk over to town and just after they have started it comes on to rain. We wait at Aunties a cozy time in hopes it will stop raining but it gets worse and at last we are obliged to start in the rain. Drive back in to town and then home raining all the way but we do not get very wet as. they Borrows provide us with wraps. Fanny gives me a lion hunter verbena as it is a vovourable day I suppose it will grow The boys all go to the Hunt Chip Steeplechase. Aimee I walk a Papas garled o to the weeding Ellen.

We go in and have a little lunch and then leave for home We had not go above a miile or two before the rain came down in earnest. We go home b Elinnga and Sop at Billmots for Papa to have a little sperect and water to keep out the cold. The rain comes down harder than ever. We have the curtan of the buggy let down but the raon beats in at the botton. My hands ares so cold I cans searcel hold my unbrella aAs we reach the mountoft county the rain clears a but it is still very cold We quite take them surprise at home as they did not expect us till to-morrow. We find the children all with had colds and Babie's so. bad that Lanny had just had Dr Gosse to see her We sit round the fire and talk over our journey after we have had a little dinner; as we had lacked nothing except a cake since breakfast We came from Strathalbyn 36 miles in four hours stopping half an hour. on the road so that was fast travelling. Nov 15 I am busy altering my brown dress as it has got rather tumbled and dirty during our jurney. Make a cake 2 just finish it in time to go to dinner. To go to dress and Polly drives up- The Lanny Molly and Dick go a drive to Paradise As Lanny has been rather cooped with the children while we were away. While they are gone I feed my turkeys and am just going to water my Camellias when they return We all go a walk in the garden We sit up till nearly twelve talking. Nov 16 Baby is very unwell today and I nurse her all the morning till I feel quite tired. Fanny and Poll leave us by the early omnibus. After dinner I come over here to write which takes me some time. I must now take a little exercise. lot what with sitting with Codgie and writing I have not had a walk at all. Papa goes for a ride I go a walk and pick at fuchsia which I say I will dream on of and let it decide my future. My dreams are very confused. Nov 17 I drempt We were going to have some: entertainment and they wore all preposing who we were to invite when somebody proposes Mr Green and I second it strongly but Papa objects I then seem at a party in our own house. I am sitting on a sofa in the passage when someone I have never been intro- duced to comes and asks me to dance (it looked like young Bebthe) and I say I do not know your name and that is at an end. Fanny and I are then standing near the steps in the passage when a gentleman I had never seen before very hansome with red wiskers was coming by and he stopped and looked at us as it he wished to speak We three them open a conversation it seemed me that he wished to talk to although Lanny talked most. He then said in a marked way that should you think if all the lions and tigers in the world were destroyed what would be the consequence? I should be very glad as I hate lions and tigers. I answered and so my dream came to an end. So if any one can devine a future from that ther are cleaverer than I Nov 17 Little Codgie had a good night and seems almost well this morning I tidy all my draws which I had not done for years. I take care of the children mend my clothes. Cadgie a Acy play and fight over the chess men. I hear queen read Am now going to have an hours reading myself. Go out a feed the turkeys I have a pleasant surprise Mell comes home. I get a letter from Mrs Belt inviting me to a croquet party at their house on Saturdary 25th. I hope I shall be able to go. Ellen and I go round the garden together. She tells me the Marsh Adelaide news I we go and look at the new shack which Row thinks rather a master-piece. Nov 18 Mama goes to town in the little buggy. Ellen and I stay with the children and wash the glass of the Chandelier. Emily Bakewell comes up to ask me to come down to dinner with them as Mr Hawkey had three gentleman friends coming. I go down just as they are finishing dinner Mr Hakes Leicester and Mr McCan are the friends but they rather disappoint the Bakes by leaving directly after dinner instead of staying to croquet as they were expected to. Mr. Mrs. Turner drive down in the afternoon it is the first time I see Louisa since the wedding day she is full of her trip and seems to have enjoyed it greatly. Mr and Mrs Decuale come to call they had not been to see Mrs. Bake for eight months so it is quite a reconcilation visit: Mr Saville is there I behaves in a most extraordinary manner We have a game of croquent and then go into tea. Row comes to fetch me home I have a pleasant day as I had not had a good talk to Louisa for a long time. Papa is not in the best of tempers as we are not home as soon as he expected and he wanted. Row to go and attend the yound mare (Mrs OHief) who had a fole this evening. Bash doing well Nov 19 Ellen and I take the children a walk I then recount all my days pleasure to Teddy and go down with him and Mama to pick peas. Bess for dinner have a pair of ducks my favourite dish for dinner. Mr. Acraman and Johnny ride down in the afternoon. Mr Acraman begins to look quite old his head in getting so bald and his beard has several grey hairs in it. and as for Johnny he is as small as ever he and Bill Papa aptly called David and Goliath. Johnny is only just up to Bills shoulder. Row rides over to see the Belts. Codgie is getting better of her cold but w so cross we scarcely know what to do with her. Nov 20 Very hot the hottest day we have had yet. I do my out of door duties as quickly as I can make some syrup for Papa hear Queeny read out of a fresh book. an old illustrated spelling book that I remember as Poll's when I was quite a little. thing. I begin a grey dress for Molly and after dinner come over here for my hour. I water my plants. Papa goes his evening ride and Teddy and Willie cause a great fuss in the yard by mounting the two grey ponies and going for a ride on them. Mama Acy and I go for an evening promenard It is still very close. Nov 21 Mama and I are busy all the morning sewing Row goes up to town in the afternoon to see when they can let us have the buggy so that we may have our evening drives now the summer is coming on. Nov 22 I do my morning sewing as usual it is rather cooler to-day. Repot my two geranium &. water my flowers. Pape goes his ride and Mama and go a walk. It is such beautiful moon light now. We receive the shock of Mary going to leave which is always disagree -able so near Christmas I laugh and tell Mama never knew her so prompt. Her advertisment appeared in the papers this evening and she wrote to another young person who was applying for a situation. Great talk of a summer residence how the weather gets so hot. Nov 23 Molly has her little friends Annie and Lutie Lucas and Essie Bacon down to spend the day but unfortunately for them it turns out a wet dey. Polly arrives all wet and disappointed as she had intended to go to the flower show but could not on accout of the weather. Towards evening it clears up beutifully fine and I go for a walk down to the river which looks so romantic now. The willows all in fresh green leaf shayng their long branches nither a thither. The old german colleges and their stacks of hay; the fenell and bushes all look so fresh now. One lone old german woman with a white cap watering a singularly marked cow. Another with a frame work on her shoulders taking water from the river and a man at a short distance carting sand. All this in the light of a declining sun. looks very striking I pick some rushes and bring them home to amuse the children. Polly wishes Papa and Mama to go up and take luncheon with her to meet Mr and Mrs Davenport if they do I have great fears I shall not be able to go to Mrs Belts. As we have only one tray now. Nov 24 I work hard and finish Mollie's little dress Mama goes to call on Mrs Short Willie drives her in the little buggy I stay at home and keep Papa company. Dick comes in with a story that the Gosses steel our turkey eggs so we all go to look for the nest but find it is destroyed. Dick tell me a wonderful story of the little Hans. They are such wicked little children they washup the Virgin Mary What is the mean of Washup? Why with the tea things of course Sally said so and such is Dicks tale. We hear the dreadful news of dear Lishie Clindening death I read a note she wrote me just tomorrow year I think her death must have been very sudden I cannot drive the thought of poor Lishie her beautiful blue eyes and dark lashes from my mind. Oh thus it has ever been with all the Oh ever thus from childhoods hour I've seen my fondest hopes decay. I never loved a tree of flower But I was the first to fade away I never nursed a dear gazelle To glad me with its soft black eye But when it came to know me well and love me it was sure to die. Nov 25 Bill and I go up to North Adelaide and have dinner there. He goes to cricket. I to Mrs. Belts Lishes death throws rather a gloom over the party as she and Minnie were both to have taken parts in the charade. But the party is a pleasant one I think Mr Green and I play croquet against Miss Hart and Mr Ludd they win. I think Mr Green is rather tired of our game he wants to go and talk to Maggie Baggat who has a great flirtation with Mr Cock- bourn. The charades go off remarkably well Miss Lawrence is quite a success. Teddy comes quite late only just before supper. Mr Green. Mr Mr Bakewell are both trying to persuade me he will not come but I say I know he will. I do not feel well. Nov 26 The two boys walk to church but I feel to tired after yesterday that I lie on the sofa I read the Light of the Haram. We eat Dicks buck for dinner and they all think it the best rabbit they had tasted I pick a bunch of flowers I reed again in the afternoon and had a rest. I go a long walk and think of yesterday feel a worried sort of disappointed feeling as I always do after I have been out so I make up my mind I am much happier at home Nov 27. Mama and Row go to town in the little buggy I stay at home with the children I am now nursing little Celina as I call Cordelia while she is stuffing bread and butter and drinking water. I hear there has been some accident with the English mail but no lives lost. Mama comes home from town and brings a box of strawberries they are the finest and best flavoured I ever tasted Nov 28 Mary leaves early this morning and so before her weeks notice is out and forfits a wecks wages Which she does quite good temperdly. The day is rather a junddle as we have to Nelp with the house work. Tedly and Row go to an ellectionnerng meeting and Tedd As for as we can gather from Row a very mywilling wemness mares a sort of sheacn the first he had attempted in public I should think. apa goes a ride and Mama dows not feel well so I am left Solitary to wander avout the Garden the on think unhappy subject.

Dec 2 Mama Papa are going up to town for Papa to have his hair cut and to fetch Ellen and then they were to com home and take all the children up to Pollies by invitation to feast on cherries. I wish very mnch to go quitely with them as cannot bear to make a course for mytllfy and do not wike the idla of a long slow drige with Mr Bakewell To I write down to Eunly and soy do not like the notion af ptting them to so munch troulble in taking me But Eily writes so polite a hote in return that I cannot get out of it.

The poor little mare instead of being at all tired is so buckish thut Mr. Say who sees us to the buggy is ablest to hold her befor I cCan get in.

And Mrs Bak goes home after the apamination is ovey Kaw a dance with Mr Maral and thik him so nice.

He and Papa have a fains talk. And he deos nat go till after eleven and sting and do not feel tired although I have been up so late two nighls running. Dec 21 so day is the crowmng point of heat the themomator standing at PBr dey in the hous I will not give way to the neat and meep my sely employed all day. Nell arrines I is all emportunce as Annt Sarah nas entrusted her with presents for the childre 6 she nas taken the whiting prige. Dane is so unnell ti is dliged to go to see the Doctor. She has returned and is better I by the sondd of her voicep. The heat lasts so it is a cantion to sakes. mell and I are gong down to the river for a walk. Mama has just had an offer tallys sister us sermang I think shey will do nicely for the mount as she is more likely to he contented than any bady feror town. Dec 22 Mama goes to town to make jurchases for Stirling and ras. I do the cooking and make a lork which is much aproved We have quite a pasty of gentlenen. Jch coms down quite uncxpectedly. and Mr Buacon Luicas come an with him. Mr Knox and Tedd having arrived and short time befor. Mr Bnof comes to say good bge as he leaves for hew fead on Saturday Dec 25 Polly cones down to stay with us while Mr Knox is away. We are justs dressing to start for Mr Davenports Poll comes with us. We arrived rather lale I am afraid we had kegt lunch warting some time. Mr Davenport is an excelent mancager and the lunch goes off nicely. The gentlernen then sturt fo Mr Whites. They do not return till a late hour and it is a digpte. When we have got on the rode home we We observe that poor Row with tasting so much wine finds it difficult to keep the perpendicular. Mama and Polly seem rather ner vous as to whether we shall ever reach home. After loosing the whip and other small misfortunes in the driving way we arrive safely at home Dick is highly delighted to see Row. As light as a bobble so he says. Row grows fightable and threatens to punch the bakers head for coming so late. Willie at last gets him to bed. I am very glad as Bertie Lucas is with us . Row is making such a fool of himself. Dec 14 Row drives the wraps that we had borrowed from Mrs Davemport (on account of the rain) home. Teddy goes up to Pollys with his horse as he is going a trip with Mr Marval they both return to dinner. I like Mr Marvel so much he has such a nice soft way. He told me that that nice Mr Naismyth who sat next to me one Sunday at colege is dead. Teddy and his friend spend the evening with us and then dive to moon light cottage where they were to remain till Christmas morning and then start for Dr Jays. Dec 25 Christmas Day But I must say a very unnatural one as Teddy and Mr Knox are both away as well as the Borrows with the exception of Aunt Charlotte who we drive up and fetch. Row takes us up to Christ Church we have the Bishop. Mr L'Estrange walks down from the church to Finniss St with us and complains he has been done out of his Christmas dinner and Row offers to bring him home to Payneham but he refuses. We have a homely dinner with the children. Poll Nell the chicks and I all go down and pass the afternoon by the river It is nice and cool but rather slow for Xmas. They say it is unfortunate to break up the family meeting at Christmas. We have certainly dared fortune this year Dec 26 All things seem as sixes and sevens this morning if ever they were. Papa is in bed ill and as cross as two sticks. And the boys and mama think it best to let him come round when he likes. the atmosphere has a little cleared Papa has got up and is busy which puts most people right We are quite undecided when we go to Stirling but I think we commence tomorrow. That is the nothy point. I work at a white dress. Dec 27 Aunt Charlotte after a stay of three days (wonderful) leaves us by the nine oclock We can scarcely prevent her from starting at eight so as to the sure of the omnibus. Papa drives Polly Mama and Willie up to Stirling to see the house with which they are much pleased. I stay at home and Dick asks me to play dinner party which is fun as all the little ones even Carliat are seated to table. I am busy as I have to help to get the dinner. The Stirling party are back to dinner as they make an early start (half past seven) I do not feel well. Row excites Nell by saying Mr Jay is coming down but he does not turn up. Dec 28 A public holiday We all take it very quietly and are all busing in making preparation for Stirling. I mend all my clothes and pack my dresses. I receive a letter from Kate to tell me Mrs Rankin had invited me to the Ferry and Mama to my astonishment seems almost inclined to let me go. I think it would be great fun as Fanny and Kate would both be down there with me. Mama persuades Papa not to go to the Old Colonists Banquet as she does not think he would be improved by the same or ready to start for Stirling I drive up with Bill to take Papa excuse for not going. Bill points out Papas fellow visitor at Campbell house (Mr Walker) he is rather nice looking Polly a Ellen have been favouring us with music and song all the time I have been writing and both the boys are pleased Dec 29 the whole house is upside down with the start to Stirling and Poll is off town by the early omnibus. I have to keep poor little Codgie out of the way when the start takes place as her appeals to Papa not to leave her are quite pathelic. I pass a very lonely day as little Codgie is my only companion. till late. When Row returns having delivered the family safe at Hamilton House. Willie is the next to return from a fishing expediction with Johnnie Acraman and then Poll who has been settling all things at Sising Hall Dec 30 Polly and I go in town and do a good days shopping to prepare to go to Stirling tomorrow. We have a long day of it and what with poor little Codgie I feel quite tired. Go round a say good bye to Aunt Charlotte and get some of Nells things It is very hot when we go to town but it chages and comes so cold I am afraid Codgee will take cold. I work the machine till quite late and then water Dec 31 I get up and begin to collect our luggage. Have a bath and start about half past eleven. accompanied by two kittens followed by three dogs and no end of parcels boxes etc. We reach Stirling after a good deal of trouble with the dogs which get so tired we are obliged to take them into the buggy and poor Prince is all pricks. When we arrive they seem surprised to se us and are just about to sit down to a nice bit of cold roast beef second course gooseberry pie and sarls. The two little ones are delighted to see each other. I am so pleased with the house the parlour is a nice large room as big as our nursery at home. And such a dear little garden with red currants gooseberries apples apricots and a beautiful promise of Blackberries. Mama goes down to Glynde with Bill to finish up at house before returning here for good although it is Sunday we have all to set. to work to put up Papas bed. Mama leaves us at about six. And then my troubles begin I have to over- see an unruly family I trie to make Papa comfortable which is rather difficult. Jan 1 I have the cooking to do which is very nasty; when there is so little accomadation. and I feel anxious as I do not think Papa does like anything when Mama is away. Pally Papa and some of the children go out and see some of the colleges in the neighbour hood. Polly the chicks and I all go to a dairy and get a pound of butter. The lady is irish and shows us all her pets which are a cockatooe magpie a canary a Parrot. The Cockatooe is such a beautie and can say Hip. Hip -Hura and sticks up its crest. We see Mr Riesden Reid and his cousin out riding. Jan 2 We all go out for a walk as far as the Stirling school and sit and talk for some time under the trees. I then return and have an interview will the butcher. which ends in a burst of laugh ter on all sides as Poll. nor I know a hind quarter from a fore. Sally has gas a most extraordin ary piece of beef salt which looks disgusting but like the ugly duckling turns out a wonder. We go for a walk to being some milk. And after been we go to the post and Polly gets a note from Mr Knox all well; no papers. Jan 3 I rise with a lighter heart then the last three days as Mama is to come up to day. Polly the children and I go to the past and then to Mrs Scotts to buy cherries I never saw such beatiful cherry trees in my life. Polly cooks some tarts a raspberries which she is doubtful whether it will turn out pudding or no. Mama and Bill arrive just in time for dinner and bring mugs and plates for the children. Stocks for me and something for everybody. All our spirits rise with the return of Mama and I have time to enjoy the delightful cold weather they are all gathered round the fire now. Mrs Scott call to see us to day and we are in a dreadful mess Jan 4 I get up early 7 o'clock; And make an attempt at a pen for seven ducks Mama brought me up. They are such timely things and so pretty. Bill goes home about eleven and says he would not stay in the hole it he were payed for it. So I suppose he will not give the boy a very bright account of Stirling. Papa has plenty going on as he is having an old sheet closed in and plastered for a place where he can get out of the noise of the children which grows very troublesome. and the barunda is being semented. And Searl is siding up the garden while Mama is busy covering the chairs and sofas with chintz we have Mrs Herdhis to assist. Both Polly and I makes a cover for a chair one against the other and each think our own the best while Papa pronounces he favour of one made by Mrs Herethis who also puts down the carpet. After tea Polls Molly. I go for a walk as far as the Temperance it is close going but nice and fresh walking back. We amuse our self by abusing Stirling Feel so discontented I know it is wrong but firstly I am invited to the Terry and think it would be nice to go and Mama and Papa will not let me. Secondly Julia wrote to me tonight to say she is in town and Papa speaks as if he would not have her asked up to see us and I have not seen her for six months. I think it so unkind and know I shall have no chance of seeing her. Thirdly Stirling is much further from the mount than I expected to near! and yet so far I might just as well be at Payneham. Jan 5 I get up early and go down to the Post to take two letters one to Mr. Knox and another to Julian. I make a chintz cover for the sofa cushion Searl gets a bad cut in his leg from the axe while cutting wood. Which cause quite a como tion in the house the two daughters Sally particularly was very much frightened and goes to get a cart to take him home and Sally goes with him and returns soon. We go to the Post. I get a note joing Polly Lanny and she tell me all about her Port lelot vint. And we get the papers to our surprise and delight. We a nice walk and read Lann note under the shade of the trees. Dcad little Carnah when learl is Murt comes up ond offers him a dallia And says Poor man have a Cordulnli and shakes hands with hum The room now looks lule nice now the furniture is covered with chinly. to dey is the first time we have elt to not.

BMut wilhout joking the children ar a greal trouble as they are so mose. Papa goes a ricle ta enqure for Searl who is getting on incely. Sally and Kate get into a grand row as they have the in pertenance to stand and talk to a lover for about an hour in the afternoon leaving the work undone sach are servants here and ask myself what are ding ow hopes and fear hone but yes I have nopes but they are not lkely to be carried out it is no use mentiouing them. Or thing we eits very munch here is the privlage or otherine of seeimny ones self in a glass. What ener I jut on it is all the same I have no idea now I look.

Have a nice little tea of cold jost Poll Ely ards with Novs Dike Jan 23 I am busy all day as I have to attend to the cooking of the dinner. and also a turkey for supper which is a great trouble as I have never been obliged to do so alone before. Poll and I go for a walk in hopes of meeting the buggy Sit under the trees waiting for a long time but have to go home without seeing them. Poll makes up her mind they will not come so we have tea. I am just saying I shall not give them up for five minules (half past seven when they arrive a great is the joy. We have a turkey sup and Mama shows all the Town purchases. Acy has such dear little Alphabet letters Jan 24 At breakfast Papa asks what the plans are and after a well faught battle it is decided Mama shall not be of our party. She says she cannot leave home. So after a morning spent in packing and other preparation We have an early luncheon and start for Strathalbyn at about two. The sun is rather hot the first part of the road but the scenery very pretty. We pass through Handorf and then through mount Barker. We come by way of Westor Flat visit Grandpapa's old place. A Welsh woman now lives there she was so kind and seemed quite to understand our feeling and wishing to look round the old place. She took us into the house which is quite a ruin. We went round the garden and Papa showed us the place where Mama used to Carry the water from and told us how she used to langh throw down the old buckets and run when he came. I ate an apple from the garden which was very sour I can imagine it might - have been a very pretty place under the influence of a family of pretty daughters There were remains of a battered old paper on the wall and a pretty little slate mantle vince which had stood all ravages. We then went to Mackle's Field and stopped at the Davenport Arms where Papa had two glasses of home brewed Ale which he pronounced excellent We arrived a Hoopers shortly befor seven and found it comfortable as usual. Poll Willie I had a little tea then the former gives us some music. While I read the story of Esther Have a little supper A long talk to Mrs H and then retire to rest. No 1 rather troublesome as his bed room leads out of our sitting room so I am haunted by No 1 Jan 25 got up early I went out for a walk before breakfast which we have up stairs. I then write out as an exercise the story of Esther from memory. We then go a short drive in the buggy get back just in time to start by the 11:30 truck Have a long monotinous drive. part country between Strathalbyn and Port Elliot having a great sameness altered by scrub then a little part country then scrub again. We reach Harts at about three and have a very nice dinner after which Mrs l'Estrange comes in and has a talk. Poll Willie and I have our walk and see the beautiful and still remembered scene of Vic Har Islands meet Maggie and have a nice walk and talk with her. Poll and Will go home first have tea. Mr l'Estrange comes in and friendly lends me Lou Burk he spends the evening with us. He and Poll are just now in the balcony with Mrs Mip Short as the former sent for her to see the full moon. They talk of going to see Mr. Johnnie Knoxes place to-morrow. I must not forget to say that No 1 Turned out to be a nasty podgy American who was half tipsy last night and slept till eleven this morn. Jan 26. Polly after a great deal of negotiation decides that we go Mr. J Knoxes and Mrs Short refuses to go too as she thinks the road would be too rough. We have an early lunch Mr l'Estrange taking it with us and start at three Bill and Mrs Henry in front Poll and I behind. Mrs Tugand alias (herself) as her lord master calls was not at home so we had to go round the place alone. We both picked nice bunches of flowers: Poly got a cup of tea and a little bread. Mr. l'Estrange amused us by relating tales of his housekeeper. Have a very pleasant drive home the air being so fresh and soft. Craw-fish sween and nice for Lew. Just settle down to my book when Mr d'Selang comes in for a talk and says Mrs Short wants us to go in I have a little music. We go Mr. Short is very agreeable so is Miss Albenia we stay and talk some time and then come back to write Jau 27 Poly and I go down to bathe it is very nice and cold Poor. Bill and Mr l'Estrange are obliged to go to another place for their bath as we rowed them so much about keeping us from ours. Bill says it is so rough that you can only just keep your footing. Mrs Short comes in to know if we will go to Victor Harbour with them. Have a great fuss and hurry to get ready (hair dry) in time. It is vey pleasant drive in the truck Miss Albenia has little Miss Grrett with her she is such a confiding quiet little soul. Get a boat and & go across to Grannit Island Mr. l'Estrange takes a gun with the intention of shooting rabbits. But like all borrowed guns it will not go off (so with the exception of one poor little rabbit that the boatmans dog kills we have no sport. come back by the two o'clock truck. Mrs short will not go to the island and Polly and Miss Albenia make such a fuss I feel quite afraid to go. The island is most barren nothing worth seeing but the rocks which are very picturesque paticularly one. Where one rock rests upon another you get a sweet view of the harbour through and to heighten the effect Miss Albenia with little Miss Garrett hand in hers standing with Mr l'Estrange on the near rocks admiring the view. A few goat and two surveyors and two rabbits were all the live stock. When we get home there is no dinner as Polly did not think we should be home so soon. I go down to the rocks and read but do not have a nice read as I feel a disappointed feeling. Mr l'Estrange come in and keeps us up till eleven when we intended to go to bed early. Jan 28 The first Sunday we have spent down here I get up and wash my head have great rubbing to get it dry in time for church. I like little Port Elliott church so much although we do not have Mr Howell. Mr. Laurie reads us a nice sermon on the old and new covenant. Such a number of well dressed people. The Milnes Mr Pois Kick. the Laurie family. Mr l'Estrange and ourselves go and sit on the rocks till dinner time. Quite a Sunday dinner goose and apple pudding. Mr l'Estrange comes in have a talk and then goes to have a smoke Poll to lie down and read a novel as she cannot stand the bible any longer. Mrs Short has been favouring tunes for some time Jan 29 Rather a drizzely morning. I do not feel very well. Mend my stockings which labouring in the vineyard Mr L'Estrange assists me and his work at the elevenst hour imperfect must be accepted Mrs Short seems so unwell she cannot get up so Mr l'Estrange spends most of his time with us teaches me how to shave. Then we all go for a walk on the beech are just going to look at some blackmen fishing when we see one has no clothes so Polly and I walk up and down the beech while Bill and Mr L'Estrange go and have a talk to them. After dinner I take a nice little sketch of the view from our window. Evening go for a walk come in have tea. Polly works Bill and I do nothing but sit and laugh. Mr L'Estranges stories which are most amusing. We sit up till the truck comes our hopes of a letter Jan 30 A nast little rain all day but in spite of it I walk several time up and down the beach. The only exercise I get all-day long. Mend my books and read. Very quiet day scarcely see Mr L'Estrange at all. Mrs Short very unwell still Mr Laurie calls to see her. Very dismal at the sea-shore in wet weather as Mr l'Estrange remarks. Live in hopes of a fine day to-morrow 6 o'clock I wish I could go for a walk but do not know whether to face the difficulty of boots and stockings. Go out to buy a pot of marmalade but Greers is shut. Go on the rocks for a walk. my poor old umbrella splits very windy and rain horid walk. Jan 31st Nice fine day I read and finish the first vol of Lou Bofoars We have early luncheon as we are going out Miss Albenia dines with us. Dress and start in J Harts buggy for Mrs Coles. The road is very rough. Mr L'Estranges driving is any thing but grand. When we reach the house we are disappointed to find Mrs Cole away from home. Miss Sarman receives us such an extraorniay old witch great big bonnet and under it a little pale white face with eyes that look so sunken that you would imagine they were in her chignon. And so fussy she tells me not to frown at her as I stared at her with all my might. And get another curiosity turns up in the shape of a woman who keep her night dress on all day. It was the greatest fun imaginable to see Mr L'Estrange with the old lady of the nightdress Dr M'Can arrived by the eleven truck Feb 1st The month begins baely it is rather a dull day. Mr L'Estrange and Dr M'Can go to Goolwa Poll Willie and I go for a walk to have a look at Griers house it is such a fine large one and so nicely kept. Miss Albenia takes dinner with us as Mr L'Estrange is going to take his meals down stairs with Dr M'Can while on the subject of the Dr I must say he has a fine voice which he gave us a show of this morn on Mrs Shorts piano. We go out for a walk and see Mr L'Estrange and his friend returning the former driving so fast a going out of his way to dash past us. go nearly to the black's camp with Shirly who is going to make a basket for Poll Mr. Howell Mr Garrett come to call Mr Howell is very nice but rather serious Feb 2 I Polly Miss Albinia go down to bath and I think it did not agree with me for I feel so hot. It is rather a dull day. I sit in and read all the morning. Willie Mr L'Estrange and Dr Macan go to see the Waterfall and are disappointed. It comes on to rain towards afternoon Polly the little Garretts and I go for a rough walk on the beach. Come in and the children are delighted they stay till late playing with my paint box. I give the poor little one my sketch and paint a most rediculous picture of a Spainard as they call it. Have letters from home and hear Row has hurt his leg I hope it is nothing much. but Mama gives no particulars. I feel melancholy this evening and cannot tell why Is it because it is a cold drear sounding evening? or because of Row? or not feeling well or because Mr l'Estrange is going? we have got so used to him. a little of all Feb 3 Polly Miss Albinia and I go down to bath and although I take great care to prevent it my hair gets all wet. great excitement at the truck as the Milne family Dr Macan and Mr L'Estrange all go away by it The two gentlemen riding on logs smoking waving their hats. Mr L'Estrange calling out The Lord have mercy on them that is poor just as the truck went off We go down to Victor Harbour and make a call on Mrs Ansly she lives at the back of the town on top of a hill such a splendid view get back from our friends in time to take a walk on the jetty. A beautiful drive in the truck home. The Lord Bishop and Newlow arrive by the mid day I read while Polly goes to call on Mrs Garrett all the children come back with her and will paint with my colours. Mr L'Estrange passed last evening with us he was so nices and so amusing it feel rath blank now he is gone. Dr Macan Miss A have a grand concert. Mr Howell and Mrs Garett being audience Feb 4 Our second Sunday at Port Elliott His Lordship does the service it is communion Sunday Polly and I stay on so late that we seem in danger of taking it. Polly goes in after church as she did not feel well. I walk down to meet Willie who had been to Middleton. I have to wait sometime for him but we walk home together and find dinner not nearly ready. All our little friends come in and bring their books they certainly grow monotinous. We have a great disappointment this evening as we fully expected the Howell and instead the awful Bishop astonishes us. and Mr Howell sits by and looks saintly. After church we go on the rocks the air is so fresh the sea all life that I practice flying and feel if I were to stay here long I should accomplish it Life at Port Elliott is very nice in spite of our friends leaving us they are very cruel Feb 5 Miss Albinia and I go down to bath and settle to go to Grannet Island and We start at eleven Miss A. Newton Short Willie and I I take the muff for Polly to her friends house and get a boat and go over to the Island spent the day there I do a little sketching have lunch and sit A talks for a long time we do not get off till nearly four ocock the time the truck starts. We see numbers of rabbits but some way they will not come and be killed as Newton expected. We have a great laugh at Mr L'Estrange as the boatman told us the cause of the guns not going off on our last visit was it had no powder. Find Polly with all our little friends and rather troubled with them. Ally lends me Alice in Wonderland very clever Feb 6 We have our bath as usual then the morning passes in drying my hair and reading dress for dinner and after that mend I go over and get Ally and Mithe Garrett and we all drive as far as Middleton in Harts buggy get out a collect shells on the beach. It is not a very favourable day but still I get some that will please the children very much. after we have been on the beach some time go for a drive and get home about seven have a meat tea write some Feb 7 Had our bath I did not wet my hair so I could not fully enjoy my bath. I do a pen and ink sketch of Old Father William. Dress after dinner and then take a litte square of card board and do an imaginary little piece. Our little friends turn up and we go out for a walk on the beach it is so fresh We have quite a sharp shower come in to a nasty tea old bread that I cannot fancy as Mary told us when she brought it in that Beety the baker had just died of heart disease. We have letters from home saying they have all left Stirling and if we go home we must look up Kate and get the key Feb 9 I have my last bath and it is something delightful so cold and fresh. We find that Hart is going to use his buggy but after some time he borrows another we have his have early dinner I go and call for Viola Garrett Mr Howell is the image of a county clergyman and so is the air of the house all clerical. They all seem so happy. We have a very pleasant afternoon at Mr Knoxes the housekeeper is very obliging gives un peaches flowers and makes us a cup of tea. Such Peaches we bring some home to Mrs Short and some flowers also \\n\""
