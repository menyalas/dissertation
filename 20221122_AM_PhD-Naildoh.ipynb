    "Yes, it appears that these might be included as chapters or sections, but they will have to be gone through individually to determine whether they are suitable. On first glance, I see problems, for example with some of these being memoirs rather than complete autobiographies (e.g., \"Twelve Years of My Life\"). Also, I expect some of these are exerpts or something other than a complete autobiography because multiple authors are represented in single sources (e.g., America's Immigrants: Adventures in Eyewitness Hisory). I am leaning toward using -- as a starting point -- a vetted bibliography, such as the list of working class autobiographies included in <i>Bread, knowledge, and freedom: A study of nineteenth-century working class autobiography</i> by David Vincent (1981). These conservatively cover the time period in question. Another possibility is the <i>The autobiography of the working class: An annotated, critical bibliography</i> by John Burnett, David Vincent and David Mayall (1984), but this collection extends well into the 21st century. In both cases, these are British autobiographies, so they do not cover the geographical area of my study, which is the United Kingdom and its uncontested settler colonies (U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand) per Burke 2000) during the long 19th century (1750-1914). For now, I will just add letters and diaries to the corpus."

An effort should be made to determine whether these fall within the general timeframe, but the actual year can be estimated using imputation. "

There is less missing data for the docyear variable so this is the one that should be the principal time marker for both orphans and letters. Series information for orphans could potentially be assessed if the letter unit was broken down.

The English, Spanish, and Netherlanders who explored the\\r\\nregion came first. They established trading centers such as New\\r\\nAmsterdam and Boston on the fringes of the continent during the\\r\\nseventeenth century.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSince that time &amp;mdash; in fact, since Henry Hudson\\'s exploration in 1609 &amp;mdash;\\r\\nNetherlanders have had continuous connection with North America. New\\r\\nNetherlands, the colony the Dutch founded in 1615, survived until the\\r\\nBritish conquest of 1664. At that time about seven thousand Netherlanders\\r\\nlived in New Amsterdam and the surrounding area. Few new immigrants\\r\\nfrom the mother country joined them until the nineteenth century, when\\r\\nthe most massive population migration in modern times occurred.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBetween 1820 and 1920 more than thirty million Europeans\\r\\nimmigrated to the United States, but of these less than 1 percent were\\r\\nNetherlanders. Unlike the Irish, Germans, and others, the Netherlanders\\r\\ndid not desert their homeland in frenzied massive waves. The first\\r\\nsignificant emigration, guided by A&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Van Raalte, H&amp;dot; P&amp;dot; Scholte, and C&amp;dot;\\r\\nVander Meulen, was planned with great care. And after arriving in\\r\\nAmerica, these first immigrants mailed detailed reports of their experience\\r\\nto families and friends in the mother country. These letters indicate that few\\r\\nimmigrants from Holland entered the New World blindly.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1846, the year that A&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Van Raalte led a group of emigrants from\\r\\nArnhem to Michigan, emigration from the Netherlands totaled about two\\r\\nthousand. That same year fifty thousand Germans migrated to North\\r\\nAmerica. Many of these passed through the Netherlands en route to\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"10\"&gt;\\r\\nRotterdam and Amsterdam, and some arrived on the Dutch coast without\\r\\nenough money to pay for their passage. They became dependents of the\\r\\nDutch government. Trekking along the roads and rivers of Holland, the\\r\\nGerman migrants sparked considerable interest among the poor folk in the\\r\\nNetherlands, but few actually joined the German throng.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAfter the reports from the followers of Van Raalte, Scholte, and others\\r\\nreached the Netherlands, the people began to emigrate in larger numbers,\\r\\nand between 1881 and 1890 that movement peaked at 53,701. Thus, even\\r\\nduring its crest, emigration from the Netherlands was miniscule compared\\r\\nto the movement from Germany, Poland, and elsewhere.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAmericans, whatever their country of origin, retain a lingering but\\r\\nvague acquaintance with the events surrounding the immigration of their\\r\\nancestors. Tales of hardship, followed by success or disappointment, abound.\\r\\nIn recent years many third- and fourth-generation Americans have become\\r\\nnewly interested in the details of the immigration experience. Although this\\r\\nnew concern may have arisen in reaction to black chauvinism in the 1960s,\\r\\nit has developed into a positive force encouraged and supported by the\\r\\nnational government. \"Ethnic Studies\" have become popular in the schools\\r\\nand bookstores of America.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nTo encourage this interest in national origins, the Bentley Historical\\r\\nLibrary of the University of Michigan sent scholars to Europe in search of\\r\\nthe correspondence written by the immigrants of the last century. While\\r\\nother historians investigated the archives of Ireland, Finland, and Poland, I\\r\\nreceived financial assistance enabling me to locate letters written by\\r\\nemigrants from the Netherlands. During six months in 1976, I was able to\\r\\nlocate and photocopy about 1,400 immigrant letters. Some of these letters\\r\\nwere publicly available prior to my search; but I discovered a majority of this\\r\\ncorrespondence in the attics, cupboards, and bookshelves of private homes\\r\\nand farms. Until now, these pages have not been available for public\\r\\nexamination.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDiscovering these letters was a great adventure that led me to\\r\\nhundreds of cities and villages in the Netherlands. Throughout the process I\\r\\nenjoyed help and encouragement from many people in Holland.\\r\\nExperiencing their open-hearted hospitality was an exceptional pleasure.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nLike many other Americans, I have always been aware of my ethnic\\r\\nheritage, and as a historian I have read most of the available literature on\\r\\nDutch-American history. But the experience of living and working among\\r\\nthe people who embody my own European heritage has enriched the\\r\\nmeaning of my study. One hundred and four years after my great-grandfather\\r\\nimmigrated from Drenthe, I was able to visit his birthplace, walk the streets\\r\\nof his youth, and meet the descendants of his neighbors. No book,\\r\\nphotograph, or motion picture can equal the intimacy and satisfaction of\\r\\nthat experience.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHistorians use many sources in their attempts to recreate the past.\\r\\nSome of these, such as minutes of organizations and governmental reports,\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"11\"&gt;\\r\\nyield a rich harvest of data but lack lively human qualities and often reduce\\r\\nthe vitality of experience to relatively bloodless generalizations. I believe\\r\\nthat the letters the immigrants wrote constitute the best source for\\r\\nrediscovering the spirit and character of the immigration.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis book attempts to provide some essential background for the\\r\\nletters, while allowing the immigrants to speak for themselves. Thus, the\\r\\nscope of this story is circumscribed by the availability of immigrant\\r\\ncorrespondence. Fortunately, I was able to discover letters from every major\\r\\nDutch-American settlement in the United States. But for some localities,\\r\\nparticularly New Jersey, a larger number of letters would have been\\r\\ndesirable. In any case, the correspondence portrays the full range of\\r\\nimmigrant experience: ocean travel, wilderness beginnings, life in the cities,\\r\\nand the formation of distinctly Dutch-American institutions in a foreign\\r\\nland. Through all this the immigrants remained deeply interested in the\\r\\nland of their birth. Their correspondence illustrates the validity of a proverb\\r\\nthey often cited, \"Het bloed kruipt waar het niet gaan kan.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWhile acquiring the letters which constitute the heart of this book, I\\r\\nhave accumulated a mountain of debt &amp;mdash; that is, I owe gratitude to literally\\r\\ndozens of Netherlanders. I wish to express appreciation particularly to\\r\\nseveral very helpful friends. No one gave me more time, sound advice, and\\r\\ndelightful companionship than the late Mr&amp;dot; G&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; Ligterink. Together we\\r\\ntraveled the small roads of the &lt;i&gt;achterhoek&lt;/i&gt; and visited dozens of families.\\r\\nFrom them we acquired many of the most interesting letters in this\\r\\ncollection. Professor H&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Prakke and Mr&amp;dot; G&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; Kroessenbrink arranged\\r\\na fruitful newspaper and radio publicity for my search. Others, such as G&amp;dot;\\r\\nBrands, Jr&amp;dot; and J&amp;dot; G&amp;dot; Ter Horst, arranged meetings and spoke for me when I\\r\\nconfronted dialects too complicated for my limited language skills. Just over\\r\\nthe border in Bentheim, the Gerhard Hensen family assisted me generously.\\r\\nWhile in Drenthe, the pleasant hours and letters I shared with the late J&amp;dot; S&amp;dot;\\r\\nWilting remain precious to me. J&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; Niemeijer, who led me to a publisher\\r\\nand the hospitality of his home, will always remain my friend. Our\\r\\nneighbors in Heerde, Mr&amp;dot; and Mrs&amp;dot; Jan Driesten, provided valuable\\r\\nassistance to me, but even more important, they gave their hearts and\\r\\nhands to me and my family. To all of these I wish to express deep\\r\\nappreciation.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThroughout the Netherlands, from Middelburg to Leeuwarden,\\r\\narchivists and librarians provided helpful assistance and sound advice. At\\r\\nthe Free University, Dr&amp;dot; Peter Hoekstra was extraordinarily helpful.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn the United States, the Calvin Seminary Librarian, Peter De Klerk,\\r\\nand the late Mr&amp;dot; George Kamp graciously provided editorial assistance.

Pious immigrants used this biblical metaphor with little\\r\\nhesitation. Even the not-so-pious Thomas Jefferson designed\\r\\nan official seal for the United States which depicted the children of Israel\\r\\ncrossing the Red Sea. And it\\'s not difficult to understand why: crossing the\\r\\nAtlantic was a universal experience among European immigrants, and for\\r\\nmany of them the perils of the passage easily suggested the Jewish Exodus.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Leaders and Routes&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlthough Holland-Americans had no single Moses, a number of\\r\\nreligious leaders did organize large groups of emigrants and guide them to\\r\\nNorth America. Rev&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Van Raalte directed the first band of\\r\\napproximately one thousand emigrants on a 4,000-mile trek which began in\\r\\nArnhem and ended in the Michigan wilderness. Rev&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; P&amp;dot; Scholte\\r\\nchartered three ships to transport nine hundred of his followers to\\r\\nBaltimore; from there they traveled inland to the prairies of Iowa. From\\r\\nZeeland, Rev&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Vander Meulen joined his people on a thirty-three-day\\r\\nvoyage that ended in New York.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSmaller groups followed similar patterns. Rev&amp;dot; M&amp;dot; S&amp;dot; Ypma left\\r\\nFriesland with about fifty followers; after arriving in New York, the group\\r\\ntraveled to western Michigan, where they organized the village of Vriesland.\\r\\nTogether with a majority of his parishioners in Hellendoorn, Rev&amp;dot; S&amp;dot; Bolks\\r\\nsailed from Rotterdam and eventually followed Van Raalte to western\\r\\nMichigan. There Bolks founded the village of Overisel.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"14\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMost of these early emigrants chartered whole vessels and sailed\\r\\ndirectly from Dutch harbors to American ports. Several of the first ships\\r\\nsailed to New Orleans, expecting to avoid overland travel in America by\\r\\nfollowing the Mississippi River northward; but they quickly discovered that\\r\\nthe swift current of the Mississippi hindered rapid travel. Thereafter most\\r\\nemigrants sailed directly to harbors on the Eastern seaboard. Of these, New\\r\\nYork was favored because it provided ready access to the Erie Canal, which\\r\\nled to Buffalo, New York. From that point the immigrants could obtain\\r\\ntransportation on the Great Lakes to ports in Michigan, Illinois, and\\r\\nWisconsin.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nEmigrants traveling singly or in small groups obviously could not\\r\\ncharter whole ships. So many of these travelers crossed the English Channel\\r\\nand took trains overland from Hull to Liverpool. There they joined\\r\\nemigrants from all over Europe and booked passage for North America.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D003\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Travel Tales&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSince sailing the Atlantic was one of the most fearful aspects of\\r\\nemigration, correspondents frequently related this experience in great\\r\\ndetail. In 1846 Hendrich Barendregt traveled to New Orleans and\\r\\ninvestigated that route for Rev&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; P&amp;dot; Scholte. Reporting to his family in\\r\\n`s Gravendeel, Barendregt wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The passage was certainly full of novelty and excitement; I had\\r\\nnever imagined that such a huge ship could be tossed about by the\\r\\nwaves in such a frightening manner. Many times I could not walk so\\r\\nmuch as four or five feet without using two hands to prevent myself\\r\\nfrom falling. This has strengthened me remarkably. Of the whole 180\\r\\npassengers probably but 10 were not seasick, and I was fortunate\\r\\nenough to be among them. On one occasion a huge wave crashed\\r\\nthrough the large hatch; I was soaking wet and my wife, who was\\r\\nalready in bed, was thoroughly drenched. Although I held up well\\r\\nthroughout the trip, at that moment I thought we would be drowned.\\r\\nBut the Lord does all things for our good. We didn\\'t experience\\r\\nanything of special note: eight women gave birth during the voyage\\r\\nwithout help from a doctor or nurse. Of these newborn, two died\\r\\nalong with two other children and an old woman. Thus five died.\\r\\nWhen we came to New Orleans, we sailed up the Mississippi by\\r\\nsteamboat to St&amp;dot; Louis.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Imagine, the distance between New Orleans and St&amp;dot; Louis is\\r\\n500 miles, a trip which took us nine days, all the while traveling amid\\r\\nthe forests. At this point the river is about as wide as the kil in your\\r\\nneighborhood. They cannot use sailing ships here because the current\\r\\nis always strong, and they can\\'t pull the ships with ropes and horses\\r\\nbecause the banks are covered with trees.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"15\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt need hardly be mentioned that travel in the mid-nineteenth\\r\\ncentury required more planning and endurance than it does today. Naturally\\r\\nthe experience of the trans-Atlantic crossing varied a great deal. Rev&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; P&amp;dot;\\r\\nScholte, who was not financially restricted, chartered passage on the\\r\\nsteamship &lt;i&gt;Sarah Sands,&lt;/i&gt; and completed the voyage from Liverpool in just\\r\\nthirteen days, while Rev&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Van Raalte, who sailed on the three-masted\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Southerner&lt;/i&gt; in 1846, remained at sea for fifty-four days.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMany immigrants complained of cramped quarters, poor food, and\\r\\nseasickness. In 1866 a recent immigrant, J&amp;dot; Koke, said, \"I must tell you that\\r\\nseasickness is not at all dangerous, but if some people knew how miserable it\\r\\ncan be, they would stay home.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D004\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nEvert Wonnink, from Geesteren, endured a great deal more than\\r\\nseasickness after embarking from Rotterdam in 1871. After reaching Grand\\r\\nRapids, Michigan, Wonnink reported this experience to his friend B&amp;dot;\\r\\nPeterkamp:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;On Sunday morning at about 4:30 we left Rotterdam and\\r\\npassed alongside Delftshaven, Schiedam, Vlaardingen, and\\r\\nHellevoetsluis.... We lost sight of the Dutch coast finally at\\r\\n10:00... truly an important moment. Further it was continuously\\r\\nwet weather and we came to the tempestuous North Sea. In a short\\r\\ntime everyone was so seasick that they vomited like\\r\\nherons.... Towards evening the seasickness let up and everyone\\r\\ntried to rest their wet bodies, not knowing what we were about to\\r\\nencounter. Still, God knows everything and cares for all things. We\\r\\nsailed nicely until about ten in the evening when suddenly we\\r\\nstopped. The whistles and alarms sounded. We did not yet know what\\r\\nall the commotion was about. We moved slowly forward until\\r\\nsuddenly a great shock came which awakened everyone. Then the\\r\\nwater came pouring into the ship. What wailing! What noise! Death\\r\\nstood before everyone\\'s eyes. Anguished screams, impossible to\\r\\ndescribe, rose from the multitude. Mothers mourned their children,\\r\\nhusbands their wives, and wives their husbands. It was a confusing\\r\\nspectacle. It was God, however, who foresaw our need and he saved\\r\\nus by means of weak human hands. To Him be thanks!&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Everyone climbed on deck to look for help. The sailors were\\r\\nbusy trying to make all possibilities of salvation ready. A French boat,\\r\\nnamed the&lt;/i&gt; Frankland, &lt;i&gt;came directly alongside of us, but the fog was\\r\\nso thick that it was difficult to tie up with each other. Soon the&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\nFrankland &lt;i&gt;was ready to take the people from our ship on board. Our\\r\\nship was sinking so quickly that the passengers stood in water up to\\r\\ntheir knees and their arms, but God kept the water below their lips.\\r\\nEveryone was brought over to the other boat &amp;mdash; no one remained. But\\r\\none German woman fell into the water between the boats.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"16\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Immediately her husband jumped into the water, and because he\\r\\ncould swim, they both returned safely to the ship.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;What a scene! Confusion and emotion reigned among the\\r\\nshipwrecked people. Just think of it! Husbands could not find their\\r\\nwives, mothers could not find their children and babies. Still God\\r\\ncared for us and brought everyone back together. Our possessions\\r\\ncould not be saved because the ship was sinking. When everyone was\\r\\ntransferred, the rope was untied and we continued on our way in the\\r\\nsecond boat. The poor cows, twenty in number, were all lost under\\r\\nthe water.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We thought we were safe, and for the moment that was true.\\r\\nBut then the sailors from the new boat sounded the alarm and sent up\\r\\nfireworks in a most frightful manner. We did not understand what it\\r\\nmeant... but that was good, because if we had known our\\r\\nsituations, we would have been very anxious.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Our second boat had sprung a leak from its collision with our\\r\\nfirst boat, but it was not so great as to cause it to sink quickly.\\r\\nFortunately, and again because of God\\'s goodness, another boat came\\r\\nsailing from behind us and took us in tow. Then we were truly\\r\\nbeyond danger.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I02.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"17\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDespite the loss of all his belongings, Wonnink enjoyed the novelty of\\r\\neach new experience and described them in a delightfully naive fashion.\\r\\n\"England,\" he wrote, \"is a very mountainous land. Thus we had to travel\\r\\nthrough what are called tunnels twelve times. One tunnel was actually so\\r\\nlong that it took half an hour to pass through it, and it was as dark as\\r\\nnight.\" On the sea voyage he reported observing \"brown fish that tossed in\\r\\nthe water and were as large as horses.\" Then on May 5 he reported seeing\\r\\nan iceberg which was only twenty paces off. It was \"as large as the church in\\r\\nGeesteren and looks like a great pile of snow.\" Summarizing this voyage,\\r\\nWonnink concluded, \"There was less seasickness on the ocean than on the\\r\\nNorth Sea. One woman from Sweden died of consumption and five\\r\\nchildren were born. Thus we gained in numbers.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D005\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nW&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; De Lange and his wife also endured a series of mishaps and\\r\\ninconveniences during their journey from Deventer to Grand Rapids. The\\r\\nDe Lange family left Deventer, Overijssel, in 1873, and their difficulties\\r\\nbegan immediately. Mrs&amp;dot; De Lange became temporarily blind, leaving W&amp;dot;\\r\\nH&amp;dot; De Lange with four dependent children and a blind wife to contend with\\r\\nwhile transferring baggage from train to ship and overseeing the\\r\\narrangement of his family in the ship\\'s passenger area. \"From morning until\\r\\nevening,\" he wrote, \"I was soaked through and through with sweat.\" And\\r\\nhe added, \"I would not again make such a trip with a blind wife for $1,000.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDirectly after the De Langes\\' ship left Rotterdam, the sea turned wild\\r\\nand nearly all the passengers were seasick. Soon De Lange, who was not\\r\\nseasick, found himself nursing a hoard of vomiting children. But that was\\r\\nnot the worst of his troubles. In the confusion of transferring baggage at\\r\\nRotterdam, part of his luggage was stolen. Thus, he wrote,\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We had to eat moldy bread, potatoes with sauerkraut or pea\\r\\nsoup &amp;mdash; all with spoiled American bacon, because the stolen luggage,\\r\\ncontained all the food we had packed for the trip, but we didn\\'t realize\\r\\nthat until after we were under way and there was no opportunity to\\r\\nget more. Thus we experienced total poverty, and we could do\\r\\nnothing but bite the sour apple and hope for better. We were at sea for\\r\\n27 days and it was a happy moment when the city of New Jersey\\r\\ncame into sight.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D006\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nToward the end of the century travel conditions improved. The\\r\\nvoyage, first of all, consumed much less time. Also, emigrants who could\\r\\navoid steerage frequently marveled at the lavish fare served in huge\\r\\nquantities by waiters in massive dining rooms. J&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; Brink, writing in 1904,\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The weather was moderately good the first five days, but then\\r\\nthe wind was so strong that... the sea played with the ship as if it\\r\\nwere a nutshell.

We\\r\\ntraveled with 1,000 people, but that was not so many, because the&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"18\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I03.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;ship can carry 2,500. We sat with 100 people at each table &amp;mdash; ten\\r\\ntables and ten waiters &amp;mdash; three times a day. We had meat, eggs, fish,\\r\\ngeese, ducks, and chicken, pastry, and all sorts of fruit, and so much\\r\\nmore that I cannot write it down. For nine days we saw nothing but\\r\\nsky and water.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D007\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe long hours could certainly induce boredom among those who\\r\\nlived in cramped quarters, but for passengers with first-class\\r\\naccommodations, travel could be very pleasant. S&amp;dot; Vis, who sailed to New\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"19\"&gt;\\r\\nYork in 1885, suffered no discernable hardships. Describing a typical day, he\\r\\nwrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;This morning I and an Englishman, together with a few other\\r\\nmen, had breakfast together. Simon came later, but did not feel very\\r\\nwell and is now in his cabin. Last night it was very misty, but this\\r\\nmorning it is very pleasant for walking on the deck. The German\\r\\ncame out of his cabin and said that he now felt very well, but I doubt\\r\\nthat, or he would have been down for breakfast. Of the three women\\r\\npassengers, two have already been seasick. Even the old aunt was\\r\\nleaning over the railing to look at the fish. I find it a little\\r\\nembarrassing too when others are seasick and I feel so well. Just now\\r\\nwe passed a sailship at about 100 meters distance. With full sails it\\r\\nwas a beautiful sight.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The passengers below deck are no longer so adventuresome and\\r\\nhappy as they were yesterday. No doubt they also begin to feel the\\r\\neffects of the waves. I have enjoyed the fresh sea air enormously this\\r\\nmorning, and found a pleasant place in which to sit and read awhile.\\r\\nMy chocolate is like gold here; the women like it very much and it\\r\\nwill certainly be gone by the end of the trip. If one wishes, one can\\r\\npass the time pleasantly with reading, walking, eating, sleeping and so\\r\\nforth. In the long run it will certainly become a little boring, and I\\r\\nwill be happy to see the land again.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt is a curious fact that, with all the potential for misfortune on the\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I04.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"20\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I05.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\nAtlantic Ocean, Dutch immigrants experienced no major disasters in trans-Atlantic\\r\\ncrossings. The greatest travel tragedy occurred on Lake Michigan\\r\\nwhen 127 immigrants from Gelderland and Overijssel lost their lives within\\r\\nsight of their destination. This catastrophe occurred near Sheboygan,\\r\\nWisconsin, in 1847 when a Great Lakes steamer, the &lt;i&gt;Phoenix,&lt;/i&gt; caught fire at\\r\\nsea. Of all those aboard, crew and passengers combined, only 25 survived.\\r\\nThe negligence of the ship\\'s crew and the improper safety precautions\\r\\nsurrounding that event have long endured as a scandalous chapter in the\\r\\nhistory of Great Lakes transportation. Unfortunately, no correspondence\\r\\nwritten by the survivors has been discovered.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D008\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAside from the &lt;i&gt;Phoenix&lt;/i&gt; disaster most Dutch immigrants experienced\\r\\nlittle more than the ordinary discomforts of travel in the nineteenth\\r\\ncentury. Often what occurred when they reached the new world was more\\r\\ntrying than the ocean voyage. For example, Matje Sneller\\'s first encounters\\r\\nin New York were utterly heart-wrenching. Her letter from Alto,\\r\\nWisconsin, to Elburg in the Netherlands still echoes her grief:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Our troubles all started when my husband and three children\\r\\nwere lost. I and my three youngest children had been put on a wagon\\r\\nwith others, and the driver drove so swiftly that my husband could not\\r\\nkeep up with us. Hendrikje had the measles on board ship and was so\\r\\npale and weak, and Driesje could not walk, so they were left behind\\r\\nwith father. When the wagon landed at the station, I had to stand\\r\\nwhile the others went inside, and my sister Aaltje left me too. Gerritje\\r\\nwas in the wagon with a girl. I called for my child but I couldn\\'t get\\r\\nGerritje and the wagon left. I called as loud as I could and thee I\\r\\nstood with Dries in my arms and Wichgertje holding my hand. Then I\\r\\nwent back to the house where we had been before, and when they lit\\r\\nthe lamps, there was my husband.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"21\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;This was Saturday and on Monday we left, arriving at Albany\\r\\non Tuesday. There the others were waiting. I asked my sister,\\r\\n\"Where is the child (Gerritje)?\" She said, \"She has already been\\r\\nburied.\" What a shock that was for me. Dries had severe diarrhea,\\r\\nwas wet and soiled and could not walk. Wichgertje had the measles\\r\\nand couldn\\'t walk either. I had to carry one. There was no one to\\r\\nhelp me so I could not rest. You can imagine how worried I was. I\\r\\nkept going till the last evening when I could go no more and I fainted.\\r\\nThen my sister took the child (Dries), otherwise she did not help me.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;They carried me to a baker. There we slept till morning when\\r\\nLubbert got us. I was so glad to get to Alto on Sunday. On Monday\\r\\nI gave birth to a baby girl and remained quite strong. All the while\\r\\nDries became weaker and he died on Thursday next to me in my bed.\\r\\nThus you can understand what an awful time I had. When the baby\\r\\nwas a week old, she also died because in my weakened condition she\\r\\nhad not gotten enough nourishment. This took away all my desire and\\r\\npleasure. Otherwise I think I could enjoy being here.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Now I\\'m well and strong, which surprised many people. I had\\r\\nto say, \"The Lord gives strength to bear our cross.\" So many people\\r\\ncame to call on me to console me in my grief, and they brought plenty\\r\\nof food. How often I have thought of you, my dear sister. I cannot\\r\\nwrite anymore because I am distressed by the loss of our beloved\\r\\nchildren.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D009\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Advice to Friends&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHaving once experienced the toils of ocean travel, some immigrants\\r\\nprovided detailed instructions for family members who were thinking about\\r\\nemigration.

There are many\\r\\nHollanders there who can instruct you in everything. With God\\'s\\r\\nblessing you can earn a great amount of money there. If you intend to\\r\\ncome to America, make certain that you provide yourselves with\\r\\nwoolen clothing, linen and woolen yard goods. Cotton is no more\\r\\nexpensive here than by you. Also, bring a spinning wheel and a clock.\\r\\nClocks here are cheap, but of poor quality. Tobacco here is both\\r\\nexpensive and poor.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;To get ready for ocean travel prepare yourself with potatoes,\\r\\nbuckwheat flour, beans, dried meat and bacon, pepper, salt, vinegar,\\r\\ncoffee, and especially tea. You have many difficulties to attend on the\\r\\ntrip. In the city from which you depart, buy a small vat of salted fish.\\r\\nMake sure that you buy another small vat with a spigot which you\\r\\nmust use to get your daily supply of water, and fill it before you leave.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"22\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D010\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nRoelof Brinks, whose mother hoped he would return to the\\r\\nNetherlands and bring her to Michigan, offered explicit advice to both his\\r\\nmother and brother.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Mother, you want me to bring you here too, and I would like to\\r\\ndo it, but you know that I am married and I am bound to my wife.\\r\\nMy wife and children cannot manage the farm while I am gone, and\\r\\nit would cost at least 400 gulden for me to leave the farm and I\\r\\ncannot do that.

I have already spoken to him about this matter\\r\\nand he has agreed to help you. I will pay him a rijksdaalder for his\\r\\ntrouble, but you will have to pay the expense of travel yourself.

Make\\r\\nsmall trunks, able to be handled by two men. From the baker you\\r\\nshould get rye and wheat bread, slice them thick and let them dry.\\r\\nTake along 50 pounds of buckwheat meal, 60 pounds of bacon, 1\\r\\npiece of dried meat, 5 pounds of sugar, 1 bottle of brandy, a small keg\\r\\nof beer, butter, coffee, tea, shelled barley, rice, and beans. You must\\r\\nget all of these things because everyone must have 200 pounds of food\\r\\nto feed themselves aboard ship.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;When you reach New York, don\\'t sell the remaining food\\r\\nbecause you still have a long trip ahead of you. My sister should not\\r\\ncut her hair this winter because women wear long hair here. But you\\r\\ncan sell your silver caps; they are not worn here. Both linen and wool\\r\\nare expensive here, so take along some yarn for stockings, also 5\\r\\ncubits of black cloth for clothing, 4 cubits of coat material, and 6\\r\\ncubits of skirt material. You can buy all of this in any Dutch city.\\r\\nTake along your church books, one Bible and one New Testament.\\r\\nYou should also take both volumes of Brakel along. Take a copper\\r\\nkettle and also a waan....&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Tell my brother not to wander away from you in the cities and\\r\\nget lost. Look after your baggage and your money &amp;mdash; wrap it around\\r\\nyour body. Brother, when you are on the train, don\\'t put your head\\r\\nout of the window, and don\\'t linger outside of the train when it stops,\\r\\nor you will get left behind.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nArmed with such advice, prospective immigrants were well-prepared\\r\\nfor travel, and many, like A&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; Palmbos, sought precise information about\\r\\nthe details of arrival and overland transportation. \"When I come to New\\r\\nYork,\" young Palmbos wrote, \"must I take care of myself or will I find people\\r\\nthere who will help me? Must I change connections in New York for Grand\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"23\"&gt;\\r\\nRapids? If so &amp;mdash; where? Can I use the ticket I get in Rotterdam for the whole\\r\\ntrip to Grand Rapids or must I buy another in New York? What is the full\\r\\nprice for the whole trip at second-class rate?\" In answering these and\\r\\nquestions of every sort, the first immigrants provided their European friends\\r\\nwith a wide range of information about life in America. In a stream of\\r\\nletters, which poured back into the Netherlands from every corner of North\\r\\nAmerica, they described their successes and disappointments in farming,\\r\\nfactory work, and in a variety of professions.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"25\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D011\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div2 name=\"Chapter 2 Michigan: A Model for Ethnic Solidarity\" type=\"chapter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;utch-Americans, who constitute a very small percentage of the\\r\\ngeneral American populace, have maintained a remarkable\\r\\ndegree of cohesion and identity. As a result, the regions they\\r\\nfirst occupied one hundred thirty years ago &amp;mdash; western\\r\\nMichigan, the Chicago area, and several portions of Wisconsin and lowa &amp;mdash;\\r\\nare still heavily populated and influenced by their descendants.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAll these settlements, except lowa, combined both agricultural and\\r\\nurban opportunities, offering a large variety of employment within easy\\r\\nreach of the ethnic neighborhoods. Poorer immigrants who hoped to\\r\\nbecome farmers could first find employment in factories or mills, later using\\r\\ntheir savings to purchase farms among their countrymen on the fringes of\\r\\nthe city. Some of these immigrants became garden farmers, finding ready\\r\\nmarkets in the urban areas from which they had moved. Meanwhile,\\r\\ncountry boys who preferred business or mechanical trades drifted to the\\r\\ncities.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBy the 1870s Dutch communities in Michigan, Chicago, and\\r\\nWisconsin boasted ethnic churches and schools supported by a constituency\\r\\nof artisans and farmers. Arriving in these neighborhoods between 1870 and\\r\\n1920, new immigrants found their own people, language, and institutions.\\r\\nBy the mid-twentieth century, when urban blight spoiled the attractions of\\r\\ncity life, many urban Dutch-Americans joined their country cousins who\\r\\nhad established agricultural communities on the metropolitan fringes. These\\r\\nnew suburbanites were again able to enjoy familiar social patterns, including\\r\\nthe churches, schools, and general mores they had previously supported in\\r\\ntheir urban neighborhoods.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"26\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis conveniently pleasant arrangement of urban-rural mobility\\r\\noccurred first in western Michigan. Albertus C&amp;dot; Van Raalte, who founded\\r\\nhis colony on the shores of Lake Michigan, had neither planned nor\\r\\nencouraged this arrangement. But economic necessity forced his followers to\\r\\nsend their children off among the Americans as hired hands, housemaids,\\r\\nand factory workers. They scattered in all directions: Allegan, Grand\\r\\nHaven, and Grand Rapids. Among these, Grand Rapids offered the best\\r\\nopportunities for employment. In addition, a pious Zeelander named H&amp;dot;\\r\\nVan Driel had already organized a Dutch-language worship service there in\\r\\n1848. Thus, only one year after Van Raalte\\'s people occupied the wooded\\r\\nshore of Black Lake, Van Driel was reading Dutch sermons to an audience\\r\\nwhich included over one hundred young women who were providing\\r\\ndomestic service among the American families of Grand Rapids. By 1851, it\\r\\nis estimated that a total of four hundred Hollanders were living in Grand\\r\\nRapids.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Michigan Background&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe Netherlanders who settled in western Michigan were, of course,\\r\\nnot the first Europeans to investigate that corner of the North American\\r\\nwilderness. As early as 1620 the French had used this area to trade with\\r\\nIndian tribes. And in 1688 Father Jacques Marquette, a missionary-explorer,\\r\\nfounded a permanent village at Saulte Sainte Marie. Since other French\\r\\nmissionaries organized mission stations all along the coast of Lake\\r\\nMichigan, it\\'s not surprising that in 1847 Van Raalte and his followers met a\\r\\ntribe of Christian Indians on the future site of Holland, Michigan.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMichigan afforded Van Raalte a better opportunity to isolate his\\r\\ncolony than did the neighboring states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, all of\\r\\nwhich had been settled and organized earlier than the Wolverine State.\\r\\nSince Michigan did not gain independent statehood until 1837, Van Raalte\\r\\nwas able to acquire large tracts of unsettled land for his group.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWhy was Michigan so slow to develop? Many people were scared off\\r\\nby the surveyors\\' reports in 1812. After describing a territory that consisted\\r\\nof swamps, lakes, and poor sandy soil not worth the cost of additional\\r\\ninvestigation, these reports asserted, \"Not more than one acre in a\\r\\nhundred... would admit of cultivation.\" It was further assumed that such\\r\\na region would be very unhealthy for human occupation.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlthough these reports had been proven false by the time Van Raalte\\r\\narrived in Detroit seeking a place to found his colony, Van Raalte\\'s followers\\r\\nwould soon be able to attest that there was more than a grain of truth in the\\r\\nearly surveyors\\' words: some regions, including much of the land\\r\\nsurrounding Holland, Michigan, &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; swampy areas which could not be\\r\\nutilized for many years.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nVan Raalte\\'s efforts in Holland, Michigan, paralleled similar efforts\\r\\namong his American neighbors. The towns and villages in the colony\\'s\\r\\nimmediate vicinity were all youthful and crude, having origins as trading\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"27\"&gt;\\r\\nposts or Indian settlements. Port Sheldon, the colony\\'s nearest neighbor,\\r\\nhad been developed in 1837 for reasons much like those which Van Raalte\\r\\ncherished in selecting Holland. Like Holland, Port Sheldon had access to\\r\\nLake Michigan through an adjoining inland lake that provided a potential\\r\\nharbor. But Port Sheldon had been organized by speculators who hoped to\\r\\nlure purchasers with the promise of spiraling land values. The founders\\r\\nconstructed a huge hotel on the site and had already sold some of the town\\r\\nlots when the economic crisis of 1837 pulled land values down and forced\\r\\nthe town\\'s developers into bankruptcy. Van Raalte proceeded more wisely.\\r\\nHis colony consisted of settlers, not empty projections of speculative wealth.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nVan Raalte\\'s experiment was, however, rather unique. Americans did\\r\\nnot expect fresh European immigrants to settle in the wilderness. That, they\\r\\ncommonly believed, was the peculiar task of the tough American\\r\\nfrontiersmen. In 1831 Alexis de Tocqueville, the well-known author of\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Democracy in America,&lt;/i&gt; recorded this typical view in the words of a Michigan\\r\\nfrontiersman. Asked why so few recent European immigrants could be found\\r\\nin the Michigan wilderness, the frontiersman replied:\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;None but the Americans are brave enough to submit to such\\r\\nprivation, and are willing to pay such a price for [success]. The\\r\\nEuropean immigrant stops in the large towns of the seaboard, or in\\r\\nsurrounding districts. There he becomes a mechanic, a laborer, or a\\r\\nservant. He leads an easier life than in Europe, and appears content\\r\\nthat his children should follow his example. The American takes\\r\\npossession of the land and tries to create out of it a great social\\r\\nposition.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\nThis frontiersman was clearly ignorant of the many exceptions to his\\r\\nopinion, but in general what he said was true: new immigrants tended to\\r\\noccupy lands which others had tamed.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D012\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe Dutch suffered great hardships as a consequence of their decision\\r\\nto occupy primitive regions. Although choosing unsettled land permitted\\r\\nthem to acquire property directly from the government at $1.25 per acre,\\r\\nthey were forced to add years of toil to that price before the land was\\r\\ntillable. Tocqueville, describing the sort of wilderness these immigrants\\r\\ntamed, wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;As we proceeded, we gradually lost sight of the traces of\\r\\nman.... Before us was the scene that we had so long been\\r\\nseeking &amp;mdash; the primitive forest.... Full-grown trees, almost all pines\\r\\nor oaks, were so confined to so narrow a space that each of these\\r\\ntrees had run up rapidly in search of air and light. As straight as the\\r\\nmast of a ship, the most rapid grower had overtopped every\\r\\nsurrounding object.... Others followed quickly... and the whole\\r\\ngroup formed a sort of immense canopy. Underneath this damp\\r\\nmotionless vault the scene is different.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"28\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I06.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Majesty and order are overhead &amp;mdash; near the ground all is chaos\\r\\nand confusion: aged trunks, incapable any longer of supporting their\\r\\nbranches, are shattered in the middle and present nothing but a sharp\\r\\njagged point. Others have been thrown unbroken to the\\r\\nground.... Huge trees, sustained by surrounding branches, hang in\\r\\nmid air, and fall into dust without reaching the ground.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D013\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Rural Villages&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe Dutch colony in Michigan began amid similarly primeval forests.\\r\\nNo plow could turn the soil until the woodland growth of centuries,\\r\\ntogether with its rubble, was removed and burned. Timber from these huge\\r\\ntrees became the first log houses, barns, and churches of Holland and its\\r\\nneighboring settlements. These Dutch-American villages, among which\\r\\nHolland was the leading example, sprang up over a fifty-year period.\\r\\nImmigrants, following the example of Van Raalte and his group, came singly\\r\\nor in clusters, locating their villages with an eye on two characteristics:\\r\\narable land and sufficient isolation to permit the retention of Dutch culture.\\r\\nOnce established, these villages attracted additional immigrants and\\r\\ncontinued to grow until the land was taken up or had become too\\r\\nexpensive.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFrequently the founders of these villages had been neighbors in the\\r\\nNetherlands, and they named their new towns after their places of origin.\\r\\nThus, Dominie Vander Meulen from Zeeland founded Zeeland, Michigan,\\r\\nand Dominie S&amp;dot; Bolks from Overijssel established Overisel, Michigan. By\\r\\n1900 the Dutch-Americans had come to occupy and frequently dominate\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"29\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I07.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\nlarge portions of several counties in western and central Michigan. The\\r\\nnames of their villages &amp;mdash; Drenthe, Harlem, Zutphen, Groningen, and\\r\\nVriesland &amp;mdash; read like a map of the Netherlands.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe history of Holland, Michigan, has been recorded in several\\r\\nexcellent books. Interestingly, the main contours of that story exhibit\\r\\npatterns similar to those of other successful frontier settlements. In 1846,\\r\\nwith about one hundred companions, Rev&amp;dot; Albertus C&amp;dot; Van Raalte migrated\\r\\nfrom Arnhem in the Dutch province of Gelderland to Detroit, Michigan.\\r\\nBecause the Great Lakes channels froze early in 1846, Van Raalte\\'s party\\r\\nremained in Detroit for the winter. Meanwhile, their leader sought a proper\\r\\nlocation for their settlement. After abandoning his preference for\\r\\nWisconsin, Van Raalte traveled to western Michigan and joined company\\r\\nwith Judge John R&amp;dot; Kellogg from Allegan. Together they viewed lands along\\r\\nthe Grand River and the area surrounding Black Lake. After considerable\\r\\ninvestigation, Van Raalte decided to purchase some four thousand acres on\\r\\nthe fringes of Black Lake, for he was convinced that its access to Lake\\r\\nMichigan would facilitate the development of a busy harbor port. To achieve\\r\\nall this, Van Raalte used funds from his own purse and from associates in the\\r\\nNetherlands, but he also acquired loans from sympathetic supporters in New\\r\\nYork.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe earliest efforts at colony building were attended by back-breaking\\r\\nlabor, hunger, and much grief. Along with the unfamiliar tasks of\\r\\npioneering, the colonists suffered a siege of malaria which invaded nearly\\r\\nevery family. Despite these setbacks, the immigrants were hopeful and\\r\\noccasionally euphoric about the future of the colony. In 1847 Gerrit Bouws\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"30\"&gt;\\r\\nreported, \"I wish that all who seek the Lord could be here for they would no\\r\\nlonger be surrounded by ungodliness. Here in the colony a man can earn 50\\r\\ncents per day, but among the Americans he can earn more. I must say that\\r\\nthose who are healthy can earn their keep with God\\'s blessing.\" More\\r\\nspecifically he noted, \"It is good for carpenters here, and for shoemakers, as\\r\\npeople wear out many shoes here. Roofers and wooden-shoe makers will find\\r\\nless work here. The houses are roofed with wood planks and can be built\\r\\nquickly &amp;mdash; in about three days with four men. Now friends, I invite all who\\r\\nare healthy and desire to work... come. It is good for everyone here.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D014\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFor Zwiertje Veldhuis, even the grief of losing her husband and two\\r\\nchildren did not destroy her resolve to succeed. \"I am happy that the Lord\\r\\nbrought us to this country,\" she wrote. \"Thus far I have not been in want,\\r\\nand that was not true in the Netherlands. America is a land flowing with\\r\\nmilk and honey. If our ancestors could see how we burn wood here, it would\\r\\nbe unbelievable to them.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nOf her farm, Zwiertje wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We have purchased 160 acres which my husband found very\\r\\ngood. He would have preferred to accomplish more here on earth, but\\r\\nthe Bible says, \"My ways are not your ways, and your ways are not\\r\\nmy ways.\" We can see the truth of that every day here.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We are now living in the house that the Lord allowed us to\\r\\nbuild, for we could not have done it by our own strength. When we\\r\\nmoved into the house, my husband was able to work with the\\r\\ncarpenter and we were thankful for that blessing.... Now we are\\r\\nworking further on our house. Our hired man is gathering trees\\r\\ntogether with the oxen and three other men. We did not finish burning\\r\\nthe trees because planting was more urgent. We have sown five acres\\r\\nof corn, an acre each of oats and grass, and two acres of potatoes\\r\\nand buckwheat. If the Lord graciously permits us to burn more wood,\\r\\nwe will plant another six acres of corn.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1848 thirty houses were clustered near the shore of Black Lake. A\\r\\nwood mill and a grain mill were producing lumber and flour, and salt and\\r\\nand potash were already being exported to Chicago.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D015\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBy 1849, two hundred homes lined the streets of the Dutch village.\\r\\nWriting to a friend in Bloomington, Illinois, that year, H&amp;dot; Van Eijk\\r\\nreported:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The conditions in the colony appear to be more favorable right\\r\\nalong. Factories, craftsmen, and businesses are beginning to flourish.\\r\\nAlmost all summer, the mouth of Black Lake was open, and there\\r\\nwere vessels at the city dock off and on. Laborers have earned good\\r\\nwages peeling hemlock bark for the tanneries, splitting wood for the\\r\\ncopper, and cutting wood for fuel &amp;mdash; and that makes for a busy trade\\r\\nwith Chicago. The government in Washington sent twenty experts to&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"31\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;measure the mouth of the Black River, and they reported that if piers\\r\\nwere built at the mouth of the river to stop the sand from blocking the\\r\\nentrance, we could have the best harbor and trade center along the\\r\\nlakeshore. This report, combined with the support and good\\r\\nreputation which Van Raalte enjoys from the U&amp;dot;S&amp;dot; Congress and\\r\\nPresident, leaves no doubt about our receiving a $45,000\\r\\nappropriation to build the piers and promote our Dutch colony.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nConcerning other aspects of economic development, Van Eijk wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Farmers who raised crops as soon as their land was cleared are\\r\\nalready doing a good business, and the cleared land [which cost $1.25\\r\\nper acre] is being resold for from $4 to $6 per acre. The number of\\r\\nhouses has tripled. Homes in the city now bring $100 where at first\\r\\nthey sold for $45. A steam-and wind-driven mill are fully operative in\\r\\nthe city, and there are, in addition, two water-driven mills, at one of\\r\\nwhich I am the foreman.

We harvested nearly 600 bushels of\\r\\npotatoes, and that when many others suffered damage from the blight.\\r\\nThe Lord has blessed us wonderfully.... We harvested about 60\\r\\nbushels of corn which is not enough for our livestock, but in the\\r\\nwinter, corn is very cheap....

These villages, and Zeeland in\\r\\nparticular, flourished almost immediately. By 1854, Zeeland had already\\r\\nattracted about one thousand residents, and its taxable real estate nearly\\r\\nequaled that of Holland. Most of the Dutch settlements, however, remained\\r\\nessentially rural villages &amp;mdash; churches and schools along with a general store\\r\\nand blacksmith shop &amp;mdash; sustained by the farms that dotted the nearby section\\r\\nroads.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D017\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nRev&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; Zwemer, who accepted a call to be the minister of the\\r\\nVriesland Dutch Reformed Church in 1860, gave a detailed description of\\r\\nthat village in a letter to his friend, Rev&amp;dot; Helenius De Kok:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We no longer live in Holland (the principal city of the colony),\\r\\nbut in Vriesland, 10 miles (3 hours afoot) to the east of Holland.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The congregation of Vriesland is located to the east of the\\r\\ncolony. Our church is 10 miles from the church in Holland, and 4\\r\\nmiles from the church in Zeeland. (One mile is about 20 minutes\\r\\nwalking). The members of the church come from 76 families. About\\r\\n90 families here are church-going. The whole village consists of about\\r\\n95 &amp;mdash; 96 families with a total population of about 500 people. Almost\\r\\nwithout exception they all live on farms.

Dominie Vander Meulen has\\r\\nreceived a call from Chicago and will leave the colony.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;My wife is feeling rather well and strong; she feels much better\\r\\nsince we have moved to Michigan in the woods, than when we lived\\r\\nin a small corner of the highly populated city. A snake, named loopin\\r\\nhere, does not frighten our children, and it is quite common to see\\r\\nhummingbirds (the smallest and most beautiful of birds) flying around\\r\\nthe flower garden to get sap from the flowers. Wild cats, foxes,\\r\\nraccoons, and other little animals still frequently do damage in the\\r\\nhen houses. When these woods were first settled, the howling of the\\r\\nwolves echoed through the night; now they are no longer heard. There\\r\\nare still one or two bears in the neighborhood and they are still seen\\r\\noccasionally. But they seem to understand that the Hollanders have\\r\\nbought these woodlands and that they no longer roam on their own\\r\\nland; for they are afraid of people; but the young people wish there\\r\\nwere more bears around in order to hunt for them.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D018\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nImmigrants were frequently fascinated by the novelties of their new\\r\\nhomes. Peter J&amp;dot; Bulthuis, who worked in the Mill Point sawmills, wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We still have wild animals in this area such as bears, wolves,\\r\\nand bobcats, but they are off in the deep woods. In the long winters\\r\\nwhen the snow is deep, they come out onto the farms so that farmers\\r\\ncan hear the wolves howling during the night. I talked to one farmer\\r\\nwho told me that he was out late one evening after a fresh snow and\\r\\nhe could see from the tracks that a bear had crossed his path. He\\r\\nfeared for his life, but luckily the bear wandered off into the woods\\r\\nbefore the farmer turned off on his own path. On another occasion I\\r\\nwas told of three people who met each other on the road just as a bear\\r\\ncame out of the woods. Two of them ran off and left the third to\\r\\nconfront the bear. The man was saved by the faithfulness of his dog,\\r\\nfor as the bear came at him, the dog bit the bear so many times that\\r\\nhe gave up his attack and the man ran away. In that way he escaped.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The Indians are not afraid of bears, for they live by fishing and\\r\\nhunting. They say that when you see a bear, you should look for a\\r\\nthick tree which you can reach more quickly than the bear, and once\\r\\nin the tree, as the bear follows, you must hit him in the nose with\\r\\nyour axe, and then the bear will quickly run off.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;But you should not be frightened by these tales, because the\\r\\nbear do not often come out and then only during very long winters\\r\\nwith very deep snow, and also only during the late evening when\\r\\npeople are out in the woods. We have no trouble from these matters&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"35\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;in the village. And if you like to hunt, we have wild animals here such\\r\\nas deer, rabbit, partridge, ducks, geese, and doves.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I have also not yet written about the Indians. They are a people\\r\\nwith a somewhat brown skin. They are always in the woods. They\\r\\nlive by seeking a pile of sticks, which they bind together at the top and\\r\\nthen spread out in a regular pattern at the bottom. Then they place a\\r\\nfire in the center of their house and lay their children around the fire.\\r\\nIn the evening they build a large fire and lie around the fire. The\\r\\nwomen cover themselves with a blanket, and the women wear a\\r\\nblanket during the daytime also. They have their own language.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D019\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Old Friends in New Places&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlthough the immigrants found much to entertain and charm them in\\r\\nthe New World, they were even more grafitied to meet old friends and hear\\r\\nthe familiar sounds of their native language and dialects. After weeks of\\r\\ntravel and uncertainty, newly arriving immigrants entered comfortable\\r\\nvillages like Vriesland with tears of joy. That they could feel so much at\\r\\nhome so far from their homeland often astounded them, particularly after\\r\\nexperiencing the bewildering maze of novelty forced upon them by travel. In\\r\\n1866 J&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Koke, describing his arrival in Vriesland, Michigan, wrote, \"We\\r\\ncame here at about 6 P&amp;dot;M&amp;dot; on Tuesday, and I cannot describe the joy which\\r\\nwe all felt. The tears flowed just as they did when we said goodbye in\\r\\nGermany.\" From Mill Point in 1854 Marcus Nienhuis said, \"In this strange\\r\\nland we find ourselves among so many countrymen and friends that it is\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I09.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"36\"&gt;\\r\\nalmost impossible to believe that we are in a strange land.\" Nienhuis\\r\\ncontinued:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I took a trip to the colony and met a friend of yours. I saw the\\r\\nwoman standing in her doorway and asked some directions. As soon\\r\\nas she opened her mouth, I could tell that she was from Drenthe and\\r\\nI asked if she was the wife of Harm Smidt. In surprise she answered,\\r\\n\"Yes, but how do you know me since you are clearly from\\r\\nGroningen?\" I explained that I knew about them from you, and then\\r\\nof course I had to have a look at their place, and I was well impressed\\r\\nwith it, particularly since I know what little they had in Hogeveen.\\r\\nThey have a sparkling house with two large rooms, a kitchen, a\\r\\nbasement, barn and stalls, all of which were well built. They also\\r\\nhave thirty-six acres of cleared land along with a piece of wooded&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I10.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"37\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;land, and in addition they have more wooded land nearby.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMeetings of this sort were frequent among the new immigrants.\\r\\nVirtually all their letters report the joys and sorrows of mutual friends in the\\r\\nNew World. News of births, deaths, the comings and goings of ministers,\\r\\nand general advice to prospective immigrants flowed constantly to all\\r\\ncorners of the Netherlands. By reading the correspondence from Michigan,\\r\\ninterested Netherlanders could acquire a remarkable degree of information\\r\\nabout conditions in and around Van Raalte\\'s colony.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D020\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Success on the Farm&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nCompared to the Netherlands, Michigan is a huge mass of land. In\\r\\nthe nineteenth century it was also an unsettled, uncrowded territory. It\\r\\nmust have sounded like the promised land to the Dutch immigrants who\\r\\nhad come from the cramped blocks of cities in the Netherlands. These\\r\\nimmigrants, especially those who arrived early in the state\\'s development,\\r\\nwere able to select homesteads from a liberal supply of available land.\\r\\nUltimately they occupied over two thousand square miles in their adopted\\r\\nstate, an area equal to almost one-sixth of their homeland. Today\\r\\nNetherlanders can be found in significant numbers in at least forty &lt;lacuna&gt;\\r\\nand cities scattered throughout western and central Michigan.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe steady acquisition of agricultural land in Michigan satisfied the\\r\\ndesires of many Dutch-Americans for whom farm ownership stood more\\r\\nhighly than all other material goals. Some immigrants, who had not been\\r\\nfarmers in the Netherlands, proudly reported their agricultural successes to\\r\\nfriends and family members back home.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFor example, in 1854 Marcus Nienhuis wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;On the 27th of January, 16 members of our family arrived here\\r\\nin good health, and that meeting gave my morale a great boost. I have\\r\\nworked in the sawmill here since April 15 and I earn $26 per month,\\r\\nwhich equals 65 guilders in Dutch currency. Of this I spend $8, or\\r\\n20 guilders for room and board and this, I think, is good wages. It is,\\r\\nof course, true that I must work hard for this, but it is easy to\\r\\nunderstand that no one will pay such wages for nothing. But it is still\\r\\ntrue that people are not treated like dogs here, and I don\\'t have to\\r\\nwork as hard here as when I sailed as ship hand in Holland.&lt;/i&gt;...\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Brother Martinus will also be coming here to Mill Point in a\\r\\nfew days and will also work in the mill for $1 per day; along with that\\r\\nhe gets free housing and heating fuel. The rest of the family works on\\r\\nthe docks in Grand Haven and they also earn good wages. Some days\\r\\nthey earn from $2.50 to $4 per day. Martin Reenders has on one\\r\\noccasion earned $5 in a half day. But then they do not work every\\r\\nday; otherwise they would be rich in a hurry.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I tell you without falsehood that it is much better for a worker\\r\\nhere than by you. There are some among you who grumble about this&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"38\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I11.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;country, but I tell you that that is a crazy prejudice acquired without\\r\\nprior information for their judgment. Believe me, if I did not have\\r\\nbetter opportunities here than by you, then I would not tell you it was\\r\\nbetter here and I would also return quickly.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Last spring I rode around for 20 days to find what might be\\r\\nsome good land to purchase, and just now I have looked about for 8\\r\\ndays, because it is our primary goal to acquire land. It is important to\\r\\nsee some land and what kind people are buying. Not all the land is\\r\\ngood. In addition, some land is too far away from water and train\\r\\ntransportation with the result that you can\\'t get your crops to market.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;During my last search I have found something which looks good\\r\\nto me. But for the moment I can\\'t buy it from the government\\r\\nbecause they plan to run a railroad through that area and the precise\\r\\nroute is not yet determined. As soon as the route is established and\\r\\nlaid out, we intend to buy land there. The land is located in North\\r\\nHolland, part of Van Raalte\\'s colony where almost none but\\r\\nHollanders live. I have already purchased 80 acres of woodland there\\r\\nfor $120 from a party who bought it from the government. There are\\r\\nstill two 80-acre parcels next to mine which the government owns,\\r\\nand we would like to buy that too as soon as it is available. These 80-acre\\r\\npieces can be purchased for $100 each. Then we will have it all\\r\\ntogether &amp;mdash; Tamme Wybes Dykema, a brother-in-law of brother\\r\\nMartinus, and I. Eighty acres is a little more than 30 bunders in the\\r\\nNetherlands.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIf Nienhuis had saved eighteen dollars per month he would have\\r\\naccumulated the price of an eighty-acre parcel in just six months. In any\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"39\"&gt;\\r\\ncase he moved to his North Holland farm by February, 1855. During his first\\r\\nfew years there he probably made good use of the lumbering skills he had\\r\\nlearned in Mill Point. The sawmills usually closed down during winter\\r\\nmonths, and part of the work force then moved to the forests to cut trees for\\r\\nthe reopening of the mills after the spring thaw. It was common practice to\\r\\ncut the trees during the winter when they could be hauled over the slippery\\r\\nsnow to the river. In the spring, when the river became a rushing torrent\\r\\ndue to thawing snow and ice, the logs were floated downriver to Mill Point,\\r\\nwhere they piled up for use by the sawmills.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNienhuis probably used these winter months to clear a part of his land\\r\\nand returned to work in the sawmills during the summer. There he could\\r\\naccumulate more cash to clear the land he had purchased.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt was quite common for the poorer immigrants to work in nearby\\r\\ncities while clearing a farm in the colony. This pattern is exemplified by\\r\\nGeert Heerspink, who worked in Allegan while buying and clearing a farm\\r\\nin Holland. In 1850 he wrote to his brother, \"We have 56 acres of land in\\r\\nthe colony, with a house and two acres cleared. If the Lord will and we live,\\r\\nwe plan to move there in April.\" Then commenting on the colony itself,\\r\\nHeerspink wrote, \"Netherlanders are blessed far above others in this\\r\\ncountry &amp;mdash; in the Holland colony there are seven churches and six ministers.\\r\\nThe children are educated in both the Dutch and English language, with\\r\\nspecial attention to the teaching of salvation.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D021\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nImmigrants with more cash than Heerspink could carve farms from\\r\\nthe wilderness with less difficulty, since they could hire their poorer\\r\\nneighbors to help clear the land. Thus, Hendrich Lanning, who immigrated\\r\\nwith a great deal of money, found the New World a virtual paradise. In\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I12.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"40\"&gt;\\r\\nDrenthe, Michigan, he was able to realize a large part of the typical farmer\\'s\\r\\ndesires. And in 1860, thirteen years after he had arrived in America, he\\r\\nwrote that all his sons and daughters had reaped rich benefits from his\\r\\ndecision to leave the Netherlands:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;My oldest daughter is married to Sietse Holt. They live next to\\r\\nme and have two children, a girl and a boy. They have a good farm of\\r\\n133 acres. My oldest son, Albert, lives 10 minutes off from me and is\\r\\nmarried to a daughter of Albert Lubbers. They have four children,\\r\\nthree girls and a boy. Two others of their children have died. They\\r\\nhave a farm of 160 acres and are making good progress. In the hope\\r\\nthat they are in Christ, they have done all this with God\\'s grace,\\r\\nwhich is of greater worth than all earthly riches. My youngest son,\\r\\nKlass, lives next to me and is married to a daughter of P&amp;dot; Huizenga\\r\\nfrom Groningen. They have three children &amp;mdash; two boys and a girl along\\r\\nwith two who died. He has two farms &amp;mdash; one of 100 acres and another\\r\\nof 80 acres.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nLanning\\'s youngest daughter married Dominie Sheppers, one of two\\r\\nministers in the colony adhering to the Presbyterian Church. Thus it is easy\\r\\nto understand Lanning\\'s contentment. Summarizing his satisfaction,\\r\\nLanning wrote, \"It is a fat land here. If we have manure, we use it, but\\r\\nthings grow just as well without it.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D022\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe search for larger and better farms led Dutch-Americans to all\\r\\ncorners of the colony. The Dunnink family, originating from Staphorst,\\r\\nmoved twice between 1850 and 1865. They lived successively in Grandville\\r\\nand Beaverdam. Reporting his first impressions of western Michigan,\\r\\nDunnink wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;This year many Zeelanders came here. They were mainly poor\\r\\nlaborers who had to pool their money to pay for their transportation.\\r\\nNot all of them could find work here in the colony, so they have to\\r\\nearn their bread by working among the Americans. They do well\\r\\nthere, but because of the language problem they have difficulties\\r\\nunderstanding each other.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Many people live in log houses here. The space between the\\r\\nlogs is sealed with clay. These houses are certainly warm, but not\\r\\nelegant. There are no nice roads here, but we are working on them a\\r\\ngreat deal.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Trees are cut down three feet above the ground, then they are\\r\\ncut up and dragged away. Potatoes are planted in the new ground.\\r\\nThey plant two or three in places between the stumps and hoe the\\r\\nground up around them so that it looks like a molehill. Also a great\\r\\ndeal of wheat is raised between the stumps. Farmers make soap from\\r\\nthe ashes of the trees and grease.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Most of our association here has been with the Zeelanders&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"41\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I13.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;because we sell our butter in their village (Zeeland, Michigan). We\\r\\nalso go to church there, and after church the children receive\\r\\ninstruction. The people there are solemn and God-fearing. The\\r\\nlanguage of Canaan is much in use here, and the Bible occupies a very\\r\\nprominent place. There are other kinds of people here too, but they\\r\\nare in deep subjection. It seems that the Lord has preserved this place\\r\\nfor the Netherlanders because almost no Americans settle here, nor\\r\\nare there any strange religious groups here.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I14.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"42\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nContinuing his report in 1851, Dunnink said:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;My oldest daughter, Grietje, was hired out in July. She earns\\r\\n$1 per week. Among the Americans it is not customary for girls to\\r\\nwork in the fields, and the Dutch girls also resist that kind of work &amp;mdash; it\\r\\nis, after all, no work for girls. My daughter enjoys working among\\r\\nthe Americans, but we miss her help at home. We have plenty of\\r\\nwork here with the little children. But the $50 which she earns is also\\r\\na considerable help.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I bought a new plow for $6 and a new clock for $4. The land\\r\\nwhich I farm was purchased from the government, and the price is\\r\\nfixed at $1.25 per acre. Other settlers (in Zeeland, Michigan) have\\r\\npurchased partly cleared land from the third or even fourth settlers,\\r\\nbut that is much more expensive. That land is not of a better quality,\\r\\nbut it is much closer to the church and school. We live about three\\r\\nhours distance from the church and school. Going through the woods\\r\\nit is about five miles from here and one mile is about 20 minutes.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D023\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nReporting further progress in 1853, Dunnink wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I have plowed much of my land, for without plowing, nothing\\r\\nwill grow besides weeds. It takes about two years for the old grass,\\r\\nweeds, and leaves to decay and in the third year you can begin to\\r\\nwork the ground. But even then you can\\'t cultivate near the stumps.\\r\\nStill, that gets better from year to year. I have plowed out many small\\r\\nstumps from the land that I cleared first, and that is a lot of work &amp;mdash;\\r\\nnot only with the stumps but also with the digging and cutting of the\\r\\nold roots. And there is more work connected with hauling them away\\r\\nto be burned.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;For the past two years we have had very poor crops. One year\\r\\nit was too wet, and the next year it was so dry that we could hardly\\r\\nplow the land properly. But we have always been able to make our\\r\\nway. We had potatoes, butter, milk, and beans from our own farm,\\r\\nand by making wood shingles, I\\'ve been able to earn enough money\\r\\nto pay our expenses. I don\\'t know exactly how much land I have\\r\\ncleared here, but I think about 30 acres are now cut and of that 12\\r\\nacres are cleared for cultivation.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;In the midst of writing this letter we experienced difficulties here\\r\\nso that I cannot continue this letter in the same vein. I have lost my\\r\\nlittle son, Albert. He was sick for just four days, and we thought that\\r\\nhe had a cold. During the last day he did not eat, and during the night\\r\\nhis chest was congested so that I went to the doctor for medicine at 12\\r\\no\\'clock, but he had little comfort from that. At about 9 o\\'clock in the\\r\\nmorning he died. He was delicate and weak and could neither walk\\r\\nnor speak yet. We have had many difficulties with him; he was very\\r\\nsmall, and had a very weak chest so that he would never have been a\\r\\nstrong fellow. He reached the age of about three years. This is the first&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"43\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;of my children to be taken, and I\\'d not imagined that it could be so\\r\\nupsetting. My wife is also depressed over the loss of her child whom\\r\\nshe has nursed from her breast for nearly three years. But it is our\\r\\nhope that the Lord will support both of us in the way which He has\\r\\nled us.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D024\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDescribing changes which had occurred by 1855, Dunnink wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Land here is getting expensive. It has already changed hands\\r\\ntwo or three times and costs from $6 to $10 per acre &amp;mdash; and that for\\r\\nwoodland where the trees stand one next to the other. Winter is late\\r\\nthis year and without snow our work progresses nicely. The cows\\r\\ngraze in the woods and deer hunters are also all around. This fall the\\r\\nroads were very muddy so that many people are anxious for frost and\\r\\nsnow in order to bring their products to market with sleds, because it\\r\\nis frequently impossible to travel with wagons. Also we have\\r\\npurchased a new stove for $20. The old one was no longer reliable &amp;mdash;\\r\\nyes, a stove is worn out here in six or seven years. Many houses are\\r\\nbeing built in our neighborhood (Beaverdam), and many new houses\\r\\nwill soon be standing on the road to Zeeland. Some were built this\\r\\nsummer, and the people who plan to live here are cutting trees in the\\r\\nwoods. There is also a very large church here in Zeeland, with a\\r\\nmembership of at least 400 souls. The building is already too small\\r\\nbecause 30 or 40 people can\\'t find a place to sit on Sundays.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAs immigrants continued to settle in western Michigan, the original\\r\\nvillages of the colony, such as Drenthe and Vriesland, filled up. Already in\\r\\nthe 1870s new arrivals were forced to find land on the fringes of the colony.\\r\\nThus Blendon, located twelve miles north of Zeeland, became the home of\\r\\nthe Avink brothers. There they undertook the arduous task of clearing land\\r\\nand accumulating farm machinery and livestock.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHarm Avink remained in Blendon until 1906. Because he was not a\\r\\nwealthy immigrant, his oldest daughter worked among neighboring farmers\\r\\nas a housemaid for $2.75 per week. Later, she married a factory worker, who\\r\\nAvink claimed earned high wages in a Grand Rapids railroad yard. In 1889\\r\\nAvink was able to increase the size of his farm, but again he faced the back-breaking\\r\\ntask of cutting trees and grubbing stumps. Finally, in 1901, he\\r\\nreported that farming had become much easier since the stumps and roots\\r\\nhad been removed. By then he had also joined a marketing cooperative and\\r\\nwas earning $200 annually for his dairy products. He sold his potato crop in\\r\\nGrand Rapids and noted that pickles and sugar beets could be sold in\\r\\nHolland, where factories to process these crops had been established.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAvink\\'s life, however, was no broad path from pauper to large\\r\\nlandholder. That he did not acquire a larger tract of land was not because he\\r\\nwas disinterested. In his letters Avink continually reported the prices of\\r\\navailable land and lamented their constant increase. He simply could not\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"44\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I15.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\nafford to provide for his sons. It appears that one of his sons did become a\\r\\nfarmer, but for the most part his children found work in the city. Avink\\r\\nseemed pleased to report their success as factory workers.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWhen his friend in Bargem asked about the prospects for immigrants\\r\\nin Blendon, Avink advised him to consider South Dakota. Blendon was\\r\\nalready overcrowded in 1889, and the land was too expensive. A livable\\r\\nforty-acre farm was selling for two thousand dollars and at least another five\\r\\nhundred was needed to equip it. \"Many people,\" he wrote, \"were moving to\\r\\nSouth Dakota where there was an abundance of good land and few people.\"\\r\\nBut most importantly, the land there \"cost almost nothing.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt would be fair to say that Avink was marginally successful. He was\\r\\nable to spend his own days engaged in his chosen work, and at least one of\\r\\nhis sons followed his example. The objectives of his other children are\\r\\nunknown. Perhaps they preferred living in the city. Whatever their\\r\\npreferences, these children were able to find work close to the family\\r\\nhomestead. They selected mates of their own nationality and remained loyal\\r\\nto the churches of the extended ethnic community. Many of the Avink\\r\\ndescendants chose this comfortable pattern: today at least fourteen families\\r\\nbearing that name continue to live in the Grand Rapids metropolitan area.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt should be emphasized that the Avinks were not exceptional in\\r\\nmigrating to urban communities. The Dutch-Americans had never confined\\r\\ntheir residences to Van Raalte\\'s colony and its rural satellites. Poverty and\\r\\nthe early struggles for survival forced the immigrants to scatter, and the\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"45\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I16.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\nyoung people frequently worked in neighboring \"American\" towns and\\r\\ncities. Others joined Michigan\\'s lumberjacks in their winter camps or hired\\r\\nout to \"Yankee\" farmers. Before long these immigrant laborers formed urban\\r\\nclusters in Kalamazoo, Grand Haven, Muskegon, and Grand Rapids.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe initial lure in all those cities was economic; and when urban\\r\\nimmigrants prospered, they encouraged both their rural acquaintances and\\r\\ntheir friends in the Netherlands to join them. Furthermore, the opportunity\\r\\nto acquire inexpensive agricultural land in the colony decreased during the\\r\\nseventies and eighties. Consequently, both newly arrived immigrants and\\r\\nthe children of the initial settlers were motivated to seek livelihoods outside\\r\\nof the colony. Klass Ridder described these altered circumstances in letters\\r\\nto his family in Staphorst: \"Presently there is no demand for farmhands here\\r\\n[in Drenthe, Michigan].\" He declared, \"There are too many farmhands\\r\\nhere, and they can hardly find places to work. The farmers have too much\\r\\nmachinery, and the hired hands can no longer earn one dollar per\\r\\nday.... Land is increasingly more expensive, and many Dutch people are\\r\\ngoing West to the Dakotas and Iowa, where much more land is available at\\r\\nlower prices than here in the colony.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D025\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;The Lure of Urban Life&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nStructured by its factories, skilled trades, and businesses, urban life\\r\\nconditioned the immigrant\\'s behavior and perspective. Because a majority of\\r\\nthem found their first employment in factories, the newcomers described the\\r\\nchallenge of urban survival by reporting their daily wage, housing expenses,\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"46\"&gt;\\r\\nand grocery bills, rather than the cost of land and livestock.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlready before the Civil War, Grand Rapids, Muskegon, and other\\r\\nnearby cities contained clusters of Dutch-Americans. Grand Rapids\\r\\nattracted the largest number of immigrants (about two thousand Dutch\\r\\ninhabitants by 1860), but each of the other cities also housed several\\r\\nhundred Dutch residents. During the period of rapid industrialization that\\r\\nfollowed the Civil War, these ethnic enclaves grew steadily.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe experience of Henry Kroes in Muskegon illustrates the precarious\\r\\neconomic situation which confronted factory workers during the 1890s:\\r\\nFrom Ferwerd, Friesland, where diminished economic activity in 1891\\r\\nprovided Kroes with only intermittent employment, he and his wife, Altje\\r\\nBouma, immigrated to Muskegon, Michigan. Altje\\'s parents had preceded\\r\\ntheir daughter and son-in-law to that region during a more flourishing era,\\r\\nand the Boumas\\' letters had primed Kores to expect \"plenty to eat, plenty of\\r\\nmoney, and plenty of work for everyone.\" But Kroes arrived just as the high\\r\\ntide of Muskegon\\'s lumber era had begun to ebb, and many of its sawmills\\r\\nwere idle. Thus, the newly arrived young couple was forced to live with the\\r\\nBouma family while looking for employment.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D026\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nOf his troubled first years in Muskegon, Henry Kroes reported:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Soon after our arrival in America, we joined the First\\r\\nChristian Reformed Church on Terrace Street. Rev&amp;dot; Fles recognized\\r\\nus and asked us how we were and how we liked the new country. We\\r\\ntold him quite well, but that we couldn\\'t find any work. In a very\\r\\nquiet, undisturbed tone, he assured us that everything would be all\\r\\nright if we only had a little patience. But, of course, this good advice\\r\\ndidn\\'t help us much. After about three more weeks of walking from\\r\\nplace to place and asking as best we could for work, we were\\r\\nfortunate in securing a job at the Rolling Mill in Lakeside. A new\\r\\nbuilding was to be erected, and we had to shovel the loose sand away\\r\\nso the foundation of the building could be put on hard sand.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;During the first year we spent in America, Muskegon Heights\\r\\ncame into being, and as I passed a small planing mill located there at\\r\\nthat time, a man came out of the mill and asked me if I wanted to\\r\\nwork. As I was out looking for work, this appealed to me, and I was\\r\\nnever particular as to what kind of work I was expected to do. I\\r\\nworked at whatever I was told to do, as long as I was paid for doing\\r\\nit, because we were really in need of some money. Like all my other\\r\\njobs, this one turned out to be a hard one. This mill was moving to\\r\\ntheir new location in Muskegon Heights, and it was my job to load\\r\\nthe wagons with heavy sacks of cement, logs, machinery, and so on. I\\r\\nworked for four days, ten hours per day, and when everything was\\r\\nmoved and the work was all done, I received four dollars. This was\\r\\nten cents an hour for hard work, and this was the cheapest I ever\\r\\nworked in America.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"47\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I17.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"48\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;After this job, I started walking the streets once more hoping\\r\\nfor something else to turn up. Thayer Lumber Company had two saw\\r\\nmills at the foot of Fourth Street and a large lumber company. While\\r\\npassing the lumberyard I stopped to ask for work, and was hired to\\r\\nwork piling lumber. This was the best job I had had up until then, but\\r\\nafter a few days there, a man came up from the mill who needed a\\r\\nman to help there. I, being the newest man on the job, was sent with\\r\\nhim to the mill. I could not understand anything that was said to me,\\r\\nbut, by sign language, I was given to understand to follow him.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;He took me to a place which I afterward learned was the slab\\r\\nhole. The bark and the sides of the log were cut into slabs for burning\\r\\nwood and dumped into this hole, wagonloads at a time, and I was\\r\\nexpected to pile it up or throw it out of the way so the next wagonload\\r\\ncould dump. Also I had to watch out continually for the slabs that\\r\\nwere coming down the chute, so as not to get hit on the head or\\r\\nshoulders. But even by watching, it was impossible to avoid being hit.\\r\\nLumber was cheap in those days, and much of it was burned or\\r\\nwasted. Common sheeting lumber sold for $7 per 1000 feet.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The first day in the slab hole, I nearly worked myself to death\\r\\ntrying to keep up, and I was so tired at night that I could hardly walk\\r\\nhome. I was telling another employee whom I was walking with about\\r\\nmy experience that day, and he told me not to work so hard. He said\\r\\nto let the hole get full so that they cannot chute any more slabs into it\\r\\nand they\\'ll give me some help. This sounded like good advice. He also\\r\\ntold me that if the boss came and told me to hurry up, I should say,\\r\\n\"I\\'m doing the best I can.\" I said this sentence over and over to be\\r\\nsure I\\'d remember it. The next morning I went to work in the slab\\r\\nhole but worked much slower, and it wasn\\'t long before the chute was\\r\\nblocked. Soon the boss came swearing and cursing, but I merely said\\r\\nwhat I had learned the previous evening. \"I do the best I can,\" and it\\r\\nwasn\\'t very long before another man came to help me; and this was\\r\\nmuch better.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;During this summer our first baby was born. It was a girl and\\r\\nwe named her Tena. She was born August 1st&amp;dot; My work still was\\r\\nvery uncertain, a few days here and few days there, but the Lord took\\r\\ncare of us, and we always had enough to eat. And, of course, it\\r\\ndidn\\'t take much to feed our small family.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;During our first winter here and the following summer, working\\r\\nconditions did not improve. We still owed the $64 which my wife\\'s\\r\\nfolks had borrowed for us, and this had to be paid. Early in the fall of\\r\\nour second year here, Sypke Steensma, Sjoord Fennema, and Jan\\r\\nBroersma all moved to Grand Rapids, having heard that work was\\r\\nmore plentiful there, but we decided to stay in Muskegon.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;On a certain Sunday evening in the late fall of 1892, Albert\\r\\nBosch came to our house and asked me if I would go to Grand&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"49\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Haven with him in the morning. He had to go on to North Holland,\\r\\nbut told me if I went with him I could visit with Rev&amp;dot; K&amp;dot; Kuiper who\\r\\nhad been our pastor for seven years in Ferwerd. He had recently\\r\\nmoved to Grand Haven, having been called by the First Christian\\r\\nReformed Church there. Also I had catechism, and had been under\\r\\nhis influence and teaching and had learned to know and like him. In\\r\\nfact, my brother and I always addressed him as Father Kuiper, and I\\r\\nhad a great longing to see him again. So, I decided to make the trip to\\r\\nGrand Haven. However, not having any money to spend for train\\r\\nfare, we had to walk. Upon arriving in Grand Haven at the\\r\\nminister\\'s home, we were heartily welcomed, and I soon felt that he\\r\\nwould like to have us stay in Grand Haven. The following day the\\r\\nminister and I started out looking for work. We called at the corn\\r\\nplanter factory and one or two other places, but without much\\r\\nsuccess. However, the Reverend persuaded me to stay over for the\\r\\nnight, saying we would try again in the morning. That night the\\r\\ndeacons of the church came to the minister\\'s house to count the\\r\\ncollection taken in church the previous Sunday.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Among the deacons was a certain Jacob Dykstra, also a native\\r\\nof Friesland, and he also offered to assist in finding a job for me the\\r\\nnext morning. I accepted this kind offer. So the next morning,\\r\\nDykstra and I started out to look for work. He took me to the\\r\\ntannery and asked a Mr&amp;dot; Nyland, who was then the owner, for work\\r\\nfor me. Mr&amp;dot; Nyland had nothing just then, but he expected to have a&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I18.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"50\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;job in a month or two and promised to tell Dykstra, who, in turn,\\r\\nwould notify me. In January, 1893, I received a letter from Dykstra\\r\\ntelling me I could come to work in Grand Haven. I decided to go to\\r\\nGrand Haven alone, leaving mother and the baby in Muskegon until\\r\\nI could find a place for all of us to live.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;After a couple of weeks, I decided to look for a place to live\\r\\nwhere my wife and baby could stay with me. I finally found an old\\r\\nabandoned house on Pennoyer Ave. It was hardly liveable, having no\\r\\ndoors and broken windows. But the rent was cheap, so we moved in.\\r\\nI found a man in Grand Haven who had a team of horses and a\\r\\nsleigh. He offered to move our furniture from Muskegon. I was to\\r\\nhelp him, so we started in the morning and arrived in Muskegon\\r\\naround noon. We loaded what little furniture we had accumulated\\r\\nduring our stay in Muskegon and started back for Grand Haven.\\r\\nThis was in the month of February, and it was cold and dark when\\r\\nwe finally got back to Grand Haven. Mother and the baby arrived the\\r\\nnext day by train. We didn\\'t live in this house long before we were\\r\\noffered a much better house, whose owner, an old man, lived\\r\\nupstairs. This was old man Joldersma. Here, too, our living quarters\\r\\nwere very unpleasant.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;While living here, we had a peculiar experience, and we could\\r\\nsee the hand of God leading us along. While working one day, I cut\\r\\nmy hand, and it developed into a severe case of blood poisoning. We\\r\\nhad a grocer who called regularly for the grocery order, but when he\\r\\nnoticed that I was not working, he was afraid we wouldn\\'t be able to\\r\\npay for the groceries we ordered and refused to come. Being perfect\\r\\nstrangers with no money, we didn\\'t know what to do; but God, who\\r\\nsees all things, knew our circumstances, and he laid upon our friend\\r\\nDykstra\\'s heart to undertake for us once more without any effort on\\r\\nour part. He went around and found another grocer who agreed to\\r\\nfurnish us with our daily needs. The grocer\\'s name was Teese, and\\r\\nsoon after this I returned to work.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The longer we were in Grand Haven, the more acquaintances\\r\\nwe acquired, and among these was an old man, Pete Van Druinen,\\r\\nwho told us he had a house for rent on Pennoyer Ave&amp;dot;, close to where\\r\\nwe had formerly lived. We moved in here, and this was by far the best\\r\\nhouse we had lived in since coming to Grand Haven. This was in the\\r\\nspring of 1893, and the house cost us $3 per month.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I only worked [until 1896] at the tannery, and then this factory\\r\\nwent bankrupt. Times were hard, but I was fortunate in getting a job\\r\\nat the Brass Foundry as a buffer and polisher. This work was entirely\\r\\nnew to me and so different from what I had been accustomed to, that\\r\\nI found the days extremely long and tiresome. To make matters\\r\\nworse, I contracted rheumatism in my left leg. My job required that I\\r\\nstand up at the buffing wheel, and this I could hardly do without&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"51\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;suffering tremendous pain. Every day I hoped the pain would leave on\\r\\nthe morrow, and again and again I would go to the doctor, hardly\\r\\nbeing able to walk home after one of his treatments. At the Brass\\r\\nFoundry, we had only piece work, and I had to work hard to make\\r\\n$1.25 per day. These were the darkest days during our stay in Grand\\r\\nHaven.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;About this time the tannery was sold to a new owner, and he\\r\\nstarted operating it again. As soon as I heard about this I applied for\\r\\nmy former job and it was given to me again. So now I was once more\\r\\nfishing wet and slimy bark and hides out of the large vats. We wore\\r\\nrubber boots to keep our legs and feet dry, but these boots wore out,\\r\\nand there was never any money left over to buy new boots, so that I\\r\\nalways had wet feet and legs. Soon I was bothered with rheumatism\\r\\nagain, and on the advice of the doctor we decided to quit the tannery\\r\\nand move back to Muskegon. This was in the summer of 1901. A\\r\\nnew problem arose. In disposing of the house, we were eager to get as\\r\\nmuch money as we could out of it, but the house was hard to sell.\\r\\nFinally we found someone who paid us what we had invested, which\\r\\nwas not much, and he also paid the unpaid balance. So we left\\r\\nGrand Haven with our five children. We found a house on Hamburg\\r\\nStreet between Pine and Spring Streets. Here we had to pay five\\r\\ndollars per month rent.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nH&amp;dot; Kroes\\'s migrations between Muskegon and Grand Haven illustrate\\r\\nsome of the characteristics that defined the Dutch-Americans\\' urban\\r\\nenclave. In each of his migrations, for example, Kroes sought out the local\\r\\npastor, who provided assistance in finding housing and employment.\\r\\nFurther, the contacts which led to employment were generally discovered\\r\\nwithin the ethnic community, and when sickness impoverished his family,\\r\\nKroes acquired food, credit, and financial support from the church and its\\r\\nmembers. That Kroes did not migrate to Grand Rapids for work probably\\r\\nstemmed from his immediate family attachments and his loyalty to the\\r\\nchurch which had come to his aid.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nTogether, then, the local congregation and familial ties bound Kroes\\r\\nto a region in which his economic prospects were unsure. Several of his\\r\\nacquaintances (Steensma, Fennema, and Broersma) did migrate to Grand\\r\\nRapids, a city that provided a wider range of economic opportunity than\\r\\nMuskegon and Grand Haven. The \"Furniture City\" also contained west\\r\\nMichigan\\'s largest concentration of Dutch-Americans, together with a full\\r\\nspectrum of their social conventions and institutions such as churches,\\r\\nschools, and small businesses. One publicist claimed that by the 1920s only\\r\\nfifteen cities in the Netherlands contained larger numbers of Dutchspeaking\\r\\npeople than Grand Rapids.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D027\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Grand Rapids: The Urban Capital of Dutch-America&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlready during the 1870s Grand Rapids provided many occupational\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"52\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I19.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\nalternatives for Dutch immigrants in western Michigan, and it soon\\r\\nsurpassed Van Raalte\\'s colony as the urban center for Holland-Americans. A\\r\\nReformed Church had been organized in Grand Rapids even before Van\\r\\nRaalte established his colony. But since this congregation used the English\\r\\nlanguage, the new immigrants found little comfort in its ministry. Still, the\\r\\nbond of common ecclesiastical origins fostered immediate cooperation\\r\\nbetween the immigrants and their American countrymen. In 1849 the\\r\\nEnglish-speaking church offered its sanctuary to the new arrivals without\\r\\ncharge. One year later the immigrants organized their own church, and by\\r\\n1875 it had spawned two additional congregations. Meanwhile another\\r\\nimmigrant denomination had also been organized in Grand Rapids.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis astounding rate of church organization was related directly to\\r\\nemployment opportunities in Grand Rapids. Jacob Dunnink wrote, \"My\\r\\ndaughter Geertje has married a Zeelander and they have built a new house\\r\\nin Grand Rapids. He earns $1 per day. If they remain healthy, they will\\r\\nmake a good living. There is a large Dutch congregation with a minister\\r\\nfrom Zeeland in Grand Rapids.\" Dunnink\\'s daughter had worked in Grand\\r\\nRapids as a domestic servant and probably met her husband there. It was\\r\\ncommon practice for unmarried Dutch girls from the colony to work among\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"53\"&gt;\\r\\nthe wealthier people in Grand Rapids. Already in 1848 there were over 100\\r\\nDutch girls providing domestic service in Grand Rapids. Thus information\\r\\nabout job opportunities in Grand Rapids was readily available in the colony\\r\\nand, through correspondence, news about the situation in Grand Rapids\\r\\nreached the Netherlands regularly.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMost importantly, Grand Rapids offered the Dutch immigrants those\\r\\namenities which have always been necessary to attract them in large\\r\\nnumbers: a church with theological patterns drawn from the Netherlands,\\r\\nan opportunity to work and provide for their future, and a sufficiently large\\r\\nethnic community to produce husbands and wives for their children. Where\\r\\nthese ingredients have been present, the Dutch-American community has\\r\\nremained solid, and Americanization has not overwhelmed it.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D028\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nEvert Wonnink, who so narrowly escaped disaster on his ocean\\r\\nvoyage, gave vibrant expression to his satisfaction with Grand Rapids.\\r\\nHaving lost all their baggage, the Wonninks entered the city with little\\r\\nmore than the clothes on their backs, but friends were waiting for them and\\r\\nquickly provided meals and transportation. Even more surprising, a friend\\r\\nnamed Anton Hannink had rented a house for them with furniture and an\\r\\ninitial supply of foodstuffs. The Wonninks found work at a paper mill in the\\r\\nnearby village of Rockford, but as soon as possible they relocated in Grand\\r\\nRapids, which they liked better, \"because,\" he wrote, \"we can now go to the\\r\\nchurch and Sunday School regularly which we could not do when Herman\\r\\nand I worked at the paper mill because it was too far from the church.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThen assessing his first half-year\\'s experience, Wonnink wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;America is a good land for a laborer who wants to improve his\\r\\nlot by honorable labor with his hands. That has been written time and\\r\\nagain, and it is the truth. Even so, it is not right to urge people to\\r\\ncome. In some cases it appeared that those who came were not\\r\\nfollowing God\\'s will &amp;mdash; and many come here and find it totally\\r\\nunpleasant. As for us, from the first moment that we settled here, we\\r\\nfound it as good as in Holland.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWriting about a mutual acquaintance he said:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;You have asked about G&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Ter Winkel. He sends his greetings\\r\\nand adds that he is doing well. He lives near us, not further off than\\r\\nwe lived from each other in Holland. He has two daughters, and his\\r\\nwife was born in Groningen. He lives well. He works in the same\\r\\nfactory where Mannes and I work and he earns $1.50 per day. Thus\\r\\nyou can easily see that he lives well. Earlier he worked on his own,\\r\\ndigging wells and things, but this work was not steady and at that\\r\\ntime he did not live as well as now.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1873, Wonnink continued to report favorable impressions:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Our work is the same as before and we are clearly blessed. Our&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"54\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;city grows from year to year; this summer at least 600 new buildings\\r\\nwill rise. If you were here on Sunday, everything would be quiet. All\\r\\nthe shops, taverns, and inns are closed all day. The only exception is\\r\\nthe Pharmacy. If a saloon keeper should dare to open his saloon on\\r\\nSunday and is caught by the police, he is tossed in jail. If it is only the\\r\\nfirst time, he must pay a fine of $30. That is law and order. Now it\\r\\nis summer here &amp;mdash; good. This spring we had heavy rain and now warm\\r\\nsunshine. The crops grow more quickly here than by you &amp;mdash; and in\\r\\nfavorable weather people are often surprised by that. There are plans\\r\\nabout here to build another Holland church, because our church, built\\r\\nonly two years ago, is already too small to contain the worshipers.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D029\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNo sweeping generalizations can be constructed from Wonnink\\'s\\r\\nfavorable impressions.

Wonnink arrived in Grand\\r\\nRapids during a period of economic expansion which enhanced the\\r\\nprobabilities of his success. Others, writing during periods of economic\\r\\ncrisis, were less enthusiastic. In 1876, Jacobus Pietersen wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Times are very hard here in the United States.... It looks\\r\\nvery poorly for people with a family &amp;mdash; wages have dropped to $1 per\\r\\nday and thus many folk have little to look forward to. Sometimes I\\r\\nthink I will go back to the Netherlands, but I can\\'t yet make up my\\r\\nmind. I don\\'t know what is best. If I come back, the expense would\\r\\nbe very great. Good night! Sleep well.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nPietersen was unmarried, and the effects of the depression fell less\\r\\nheavily on him than on men with families. Thus he remained rather\\r\\nlighthearted about his circumstances. After he was laid off from his factory\\r\\njob, he acquired work as a farmhand twenty-five miles outside of Grand\\r\\nRapids. He had not yet seen the farmer, and explained, \"All this is by word\\r\\nof mouth, and if I don\\'t like what I see, I\\'ll just leave. This job is with the\\r\\nYankees &amp;mdash; &amp;lsquo;Yankees&amp;rsquo; is what we call the Americans here.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1884, during another period of economic crisis, S&amp;dot; Timmerman\\r\\nwrote, \"At the moment it is not very pleasant here. Times are hard. There\\r\\nare hundreds of men without work. We have not yet suffered from this but\\r\\nour wages are lower. I have worked in the factory for three years without\\r\\nunemployment. Thus it is a blessing that we can earn our own bread.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D030\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Grand Rapids: A Place for the Little People&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWhatever their individual disappointments and successes, Dutch\\r\\nimmigrants came to Grand Rapids in a steady stream. But the city attracted\\r\\nlaboring folk rather than the educated. As A&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Van Raalte explained to\\r\\nAbraham Kuyper in 1872, there was some need for schoolteachers among\\r\\nthe Dutch, but the great mass of immigrants would do best by seeking work\\r\\nin factories or as skilled workmen. An immigrant named J&amp;dot; Verweg had\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"55\"&gt;\\r\\ncome to Holland, Michigan, bearing a letter of recommendation from\\r\\nAbraham Kuyper. Van Raalte wrote Kuyper, \"I\\'m sorry if I have\\r\\ndisappointed you, but your recommendations do little good here, and my\\r\\nbroad recommendations are equally useless. Strenuous exertion is the only\\r\\nthing that counts here.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nVerweg, it seems, had hoped to find work in an office and expected\\r\\nwell-paid responsibilities, but he was disappointed. Van Raalte painted\\r\\nanother picture of the opportunities in Grand Rapids, \"where,\" he wrote,\\r\\n\"many Hollanders live in a fast-growing factory town. They use hand\\r\\nlaborers in the factory for making furniture, doors, and windows.... The\\r\\nskilled jobs pay the best and provide good prospects for those who will\\r\\nlearn.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nVan Raalte\\'s message differed little from that of ordinary laborers who\\r\\nsent letters to their friends and relatives. Their reports provided sufficient\\r\\nincentive to attract the common folk. Agnes Nestor described the coming\\r\\nof these new immigrants in her memoirs from the 1880s. \"We liked living\\r\\nnear the railroad depot,\" she wrote. \"We could see the trains arriving, and\\r\\nwhen there was a trainload of Dutch immigrants coming in, we would hurry\\r\\ndown to the depot. The newcomers still wore their native costumes and\\r\\ntheir clumping wooden shoes. They came to work in the Grand Rapids\\r\\nfurniture factories, and they brought along their families.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNestor correctly recognized that the Dutch tended to immigrate in\\r\\nfamily groups. But large numbers of unmarried immigrants also settled in\\r\\nwest Michigan. While family members could encourage each other in the\\r\\nface of loneliness and insecurity, single folk were more susceptible to social\\r\\nisolation and homesickness. Though their economic burdens were relatively\\r\\nlight, they frequently missed the supporting concern of their parents and\\r\\nsiblings. Some, like Jan Hofman, boarded with friends or in the homes of\\r\\nimmigrant families where they could recapture some aspects of family life.\\r\\nNonetheless, intimate family connections could only be maintained with\\r\\ncorrespondence.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D031\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nPleading with his brother, \"I hope you will write back directly. You\\r\\nwill, won\\'t you? Begin as soon as you receive this letter!\" Jan Hofman used\\r\\nnearly half of his November 9, 1909, letter to discuss the sending and\\r\\nmissending of letters. The dilemma that motivated his pleas concerned the\\r\\nmost serious decisions of his life. He had immigrated to Grand Rapids,\\r\\nwhere he found pleasant and profitable employment, but he had left his\\r\\nsweetheart in Groningen.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Your report about Geesje was hard for me to read. I don\\'t\\r\\nknow what to say, but I\\'ll need more time. I\\'ll write about it next\\r\\ntime. I love her, as you can plainly see, but I must also reckon with\\r\\nthe fact that a worker is far better off here than by you. Then too, she\\r\\ndoes not yet have permission to marry from her parents, and I will\\r\\ncertainly not force her against their will. Perhaps it would be best if&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"56\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;we ended our relationship &amp;mdash; even if that is hard for me.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;At the same time, I will not say that I will never come back to\\r\\nHolland. I hope I will. But even so, I don\\'t think she will come back\\r\\nwith me here &amp;mdash; and for me to begin working there again &amp;mdash; it is so\\r\\ncramped and lacking in opportunity &amp;mdash; especially after getting used to\\r\\nthis place. But you never know how things will turn out here. Men\\r\\nmake plans, but God decides, and that is for the best anyway.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nGeesje remained in Groningen and Jan stayed in Michigan, where his\\r\\nattachment to the opportunities that Grand Rapids provided dissolved his\\r\\nromance. His work in furniture factories, coal yards, and finally as a butcher\\r\\npaid well ($12 per week), and he urged his brother to join him. \"In all\\r\\nhonesty,\" he declared, \"it is much better here for a working man.\" Of\\r\\nGeesje he wrote nothing after 1909.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nStill, the Furniture City did not satisfy every immigrant. W&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; De\\r\\nLange\\'s lengthy account in 1873 includes a succinct if prejudicial sketch of\\r\\nthe city\\'s ethnic groups. \"The English,\" he wrote, \"are very wasteful, and\\r\\nmake a great deal of fuss, as is apparent from their political posters and\\r\\nannouncements &amp;mdash; sometimes they are as large as a house gable. The\\r\\nHollanders here are industrious and miserly. The Germans are crafty\\r\\ntradesmen. The Irish are lazy and good-for-nothing: thus it is not only the\\r\\nformer black slaves who are poor here.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe blacks, though, are very spirited and highly honored when you\\r\\ngreet them. The American\\'s idol is the woman &amp;mdash; to such an extent that even\\r\\nthe richest man would not think of asking his maid to polish his boots. The\\r\\nAmerican woman is lazy, proud, dirty, and wasteful. If you acquired one\\r\\nwith a $50,000 dowry, she would still be too expensive to keep.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D032\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThough he had no diploma, De Lange found employment as the\\r\\nDutch language teacher for the children of the Spring Street First Christian\\r\\nReformed Church. He lived in a downtown apartment and described the\\r\\ncity more generously than its people:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Grand Rapids is a city situated one-half on hills and the other\\r\\nhalf in a valley. It is larger than Amsterdam but not so cramped. It\\r\\nhas a population of 30,000 from all nations. It has 42 churches,\\r\\nsome of which cost $157,000. The Americans place a lot of value on\\r\\nworship. There are also many factories, large stores, and expensive\\r\\nbuildings, and many wooden houses which are well furnished. I live in\\r\\na second-floor apartment and pay $2 per week. It consists of two\\r\\nrooms, two windowless bedrooms, and many cupboards. It is located\\r\\nacross the street from my school.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThree months later, De Lange continued his description of Grand\\r\\nRapids:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We have already had (what seems like) three winters,\\r\\nsometimes so cold that you have to cover your whole head.

If I wanted to declare myself a doctor\\r\\ntomorrow, no one would prevent me. But whoever has the best proof\\r\\nof training has the best reputation. Teachers with diplomas are\\r\\ndifficult to find here.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDespite their excesses, De Lange\\'s observations contained considerable\\r\\ntruth. Grand Rapids did offer great economic potential for advancement;\\r\\nsubsequent developments within the immigrant community readily illustrate\\r\\nthis fact.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Marks of Success&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDutch immigrants have made Grand Rapids a center for the printing\\r\\nof religious and theological publications and one of the baking capitals of\\r\\nAmerica. The William B&amp;dot; Eerdmans Company, founded in 1910, was the\\r\\nfirst of three larger publishing companies which presently include\\r\\nZondervans and Baker Book House. And the Hekman Biscuit Company,\\r\\nwhich originated in 1893, has become one of the three largest baking\\r\\ncompanies in America.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"58\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nGrand Rapids has also become the administrative center of the\\r\\nChristian Reformed Church, which has founded a number of charitable and\\r\\neducational institutions throughout the United States. In Grand Rapids,\\r\\nCalvin College is the most prominent of these institutions. The college has\\r\\neducated thousands of the immigrants\\' children for a wide variety of\\r\\nprofessions.

Over the next\\r\\ndecade canals and railroads bound the city to a vast\\r\\nagricultural hinterland, and Chicago became a center for grain trade, meat\\r\\nprocessing, and the manufacture of agricultural machinery. Chicago also\\r\\nbecame the railroad transportation center of the Midwest, the place where\\r\\nGeorge Pullman organized a company to fabricate railroad cars. By 1870,\\r\\nthis Illinois city boasted a population of 300,000.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Two Settlements: The Low Prairie and the High Prairie&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe Dutch entered this area in 1846, when six families purchased a\\r\\nregion of land called the Low Prairie. Later, remembering their place of\\r\\nbirth, they dubbed the village South Holland.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1849 another cluster of Dutch families moved onto the open land\\r\\nsix miles closer to Chicago and named their settlement the High Prairie.\\r\\nAfter a time this area was called Roseland.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThese agricultural communities found ready markets in Chicago and\\r\\ntended to concentrate on garden farming. In a short time Dutch settlers\\r\\nbranched out to the southeast, occupying additional farmland in Oak Glen\\r\\nand Munster. By 1853 Dutch immigrants had claimed several thousand acres\\r\\nand had access to Ridge Road, a main artery to the Chicago markets. Over\\r\\nthe next forty years these original settlements spawned new Dutch-American\\r\\ncommunities in Highland, De Motte, and Wichert, all with\\r\\naccess to Chicago\\'s markets.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"60\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I21.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAmong these early agricultural settlements, Roseland was the first to\\r\\nbecome diversified. It all started when George Pullman constructed his\\r\\nrailroad car factory within easy reach of the Dutch settlement. The factory\\r\\nattracted a large work force, and property values rose rapidly. Land\\r\\npurchased at $5 per acre in 1849 sold for $2,000 per acre in 1880. At such\\r\\nprices farmers sold to subdividers and moved to less expensive lands\\r\\navailable among their countrymen in South Holland, Munster, and\\r\\nelsewhere.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMany of the immigrants who joined the Roseland community after\\r\\n1880 became urbanites, often finding employment in the factories of George\\r\\nPullman. But they remained Dutch: the Roseland-South Holland nexus\\r\\ncreated an urban-rural region in which Dutch-American institutions could\\r\\nflourish and expand. Farmers\\' sons, seeking release from the land, could find\\r\\nemployment and the ministrations of a Dutch church in Roseland as well as\\r\\nin the country.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;The Groninger\\'s Hoek&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThere was also a growing concentration of Dutch-Americans close to\\r\\nChicago\\'s center. That neighborhood, often called the \"Groninger\\'s Hoek,\"\\r\\ndates from 1848. The earliest settlers there, primarily from Groningen,\\r\\nfound profitable employment in Chicago. Peter Ritsma from Vierhuizen\\r\\nwrote that he and his brother were \"earning $18 per month. We pay $2 for\\r\\nboard and laundry so that each month we can save fl&amp;dot; 25, and besides have\\r\\nmoney for clothes, tobacco, and so forth. Jacob is working for a milkman\\r\\nand I am working for a brewer.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"61\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSince these immigrants had no Dutch church until 1858, they did not\\r\\ndemonstrate the same degree of ethnic unity evident in such communities\\r\\nas South Holland and Roseland. Rev&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Vander Meulen, the founder of the\\r\\nZeeland, Michigan, colony, served this Chicago church from 1858 to 1860;\\r\\nbut the church did not thrive until Rev&amp;dot; de Beij accepted their call in 1868.\\r\\nWithout his vigorous leadership this Dutch community in Chicago probably\\r\\nwould have become stagnant or ethnically mingled.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D034\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nLike his parishioners, de Beij had immigrated from Groningen, and he\\r\\nsoon became an ardent advocate of emigration to Chicago. By 1869 he was\\r\\nalready providing instructions to prospective emigrants. In the &lt;i&gt;Provincial\\r\\nGroninger Courant&lt;/i&gt; he suggested that immigrants could avoid complications\\r\\nafter arriving in New York by traveling on the Pennsylvania Central\\r\\nRailroad. Earlier travelers had complained that their trip to Chicago had\\r\\ntaken a whole week because of delays and false information. To avoid this,\\r\\nde Beij offered precise instructions:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;People should follow these instructions &amp;mdash; buy your tickets at the\\r\\nNew York office located at No&amp;dot; 8 Battery Place, and Pier No&amp;dot; 1,\\r\\nNorth River, which is just a few steps away from Castle Garden.\\r\\nThey will take particular care with your luggage. Immigrants will get\\r\\ntickets for their goods in Castle Garden and they will exchange these\\r\\ntickets for their luggage when they arrive at their destination. Every\\r\\npassenger is allowed 80 pounds (Dutch) of luggage without extra\\r\\ncost, and for those who buy tickets from the above-named office, their\\r\\nluggage will be picked up from Castle Garden and other places and be\\r\\ncarried to the railroad station without cost.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The passenger cars are well-ventilated, comfortable, and\\r\\nfurnished with water and lights. The passengers, or immigrants, will\\r\\nreach Chicago from New York in just 40 hours and their luggage will\\r\\nbe carried on the same train. Other destinations will be reached at the\\r\\nsame rate of speed, depending on the distance from New York.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The agent at the Pennsylvania Central Station is John\\r\\nMcDonald, No&amp;dot; 8 Battery Place and Pier No&amp;dot; 1, North River, New\\r\\nYork. It is my concern and interest in the welfare of my [countrymen]\\r\\nwhich has motivated me to search out this information, and people\\r\\ncan rest assured that the above information is accurate and they can\\r\\ndisregard whatever else they have heard.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nTwo years later de Beij wrote a detailed eye-witness account of the\\r\\nChicago Fire. He reported that among those people attending the three\\r\\nChicago Dutch churches, only two families had suffered losses. Of the\\r\\nNetherlanders attending English churches de Beij could make no accurate\\r\\nreport, but he estimated that no more than twenty Dutch families had been\\r\\nburned out by the fire. Despite the huge destruction caused by the fire, de\\r\\nBeij remained confident about Chicago\\'s future. He wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"62\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I22.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;There will be work and high wages in this city for years to\\r\\ncome &amp;mdash; even better than it has been before. Thousands upon\\r\\nthousands will be able to find work here in the future. If ever there\\r\\nwas a time when people could come to America with assurance that\\r\\nthey could improve their situation by working diligently (and this has\\r\\nalready been the case for many years), that time is now. But, just the\\r\\nsame, no one should imagine that he can get money without work &amp;mdash;\\r\\nand in most cases that work will be done with one\\'s hands.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nInfluenced by such encouragement, a large number of Groningers\\r\\nimmigrated to Chicago. Although a nucleus of these remained near the\\r\\ncenter of the city until the 1920s, many of the others moved southward in\\r\\nthe 1880s, organizing the Englewood neighborhood.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHenry Stob, professor of ethics, emeritus, at Calvin Seminary,\\r\\nremembers his boyhood in the old \"Groninger\\'s Hoek.\" It was, he recalls, a\\r\\ntightly knit colony of Netherlanders who spoke Dutch at home, worked\\r\\nhard, and harbored intense loyalties for their Dutch churches. His father\\r\\nhad attempted various occupations, including the cultivation of an eighty-acre\\r\\nfarm on Chicago\\'s western fringes. But, for most of his life Stob worked\\r\\nas a trash hauler or as the proprietor of his own feed and grain store. During\\r\\na three-year interval the Stobs attempted farming in a Dutch settlement in\\r\\nWinie, Texas, but they could not endure the hardships of alternating\\r\\ndrought and flood. Thereafter they returned to their former Chicago\\r\\nneighborhood, and moved, several years later, to Englewood to be near the\\r\\nChristian high school. In all these migrations the Stobs never deserted the\\r\\nsupporting comforts of the Dutch church and its members.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"63\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D035\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Moving to the Suburbs&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nToday few Dutch-Americans remain in their original urban\\r\\nneighborhoods. They have relocated in the suburbs. Often they were able to\\r\\nrelocate near the borders of the city, in places where farmer immigrants had\\r\\nalready constructed Dutch churches and Christian schools.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe village of South Holland readily illustrates this development. In\\r\\n1950 the town had 3,247 residents and included 85 farms. By 1960 the\\r\\npopulation had risen to 10,412 and the farms were reduced to 47. At the\\r\\nsame time, the number of major Dutch-American churches had increased\\r\\nfrom three to seven. Those farmers who wished to remain farmers had no\\r\\ndifficulty selling their land in South Holland for $2,000 to $3,000 per acre.\\r\\nWith such profits they could easily relocate in rural areas like De Motte,\\r\\nwhere, again, familiar Dutch-American institutions had preceded them.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThus, for over a century Dutch immigrants arriving in the Chicago\\r\\narea were able to select the occupations most suited to their skills and\\r\\nambitions while avoiding the harsher challenges of social novelty. As one\\r\\nimmigrant writing in 1853 said, \"Come to live with us here in [Roseland].\\r\\nHere we have freedom, equality, brotherhood &amp;mdash; these are no idle words.\\r\\nAnyone who wants to work and is able to do so can easily earn a\\r\\ncomfortable living &amp;mdash; can live peacefully and enjoy life.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D036\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAbout thirty years later, when Chicago had already grown into a large\\r\\ncity, U&amp;dot; V&amp;dot; L&amp;dot; Nywening provided a wide-ranging overview of the Roseland\\r\\ncommunity.

They could raise much more than they do. Still, there is no\\r\\npoverty here. Much of the crop goes to waste in the fields.\\r\\nConcerning potatoes, they harvest only the large ones and leave the\\r\\nrest to rot.... When they have enough, most Americans are lazy\\r\\nand indifferent about such waste.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Every day, long trains go past my house loaded with meat and\\r\\nbacon. The meat goes to New York, and from there much of it goes\\r\\nto Europe. But the poor people of Europe hardly see any of it, while\\r\\nhere, everyone eats as much as he wishes. So it should be easy for\\r\\nyou to understand that we enjoy life here.... With my two boys I\\r\\nearn $80 per month &amp;mdash; so you can well imagine that, if we remain\\r\\nhealthy, I will be a man of means in a few short years. Thus anyone\\r\\nwho despises my new fatherland is no friend of mine.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D037\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Roseland: Thorns or Roses?&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nOthers, however, found Roseland more than disappointing. Disputing\\r\\nreports of Roseland\\'s prosperity in the &lt;i&gt;Nieuw Advertentieblad&lt;/i&gt; of Friesland,\\r\\nWilliam De Jong concluded, \"You will seek vainly for roses in Roseland, but\\r\\nthey have thorns in abundance.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis debate about immigrant opportunities in Roseland had begun in\\r\\nFebruary, 1888, when De Jong had advised other Dutch families to remain\\r\\nin the Netherlands if they were doing well. He further suggested that the\\r\\nwinters in Roseland were unbearably cold and that employment in George\\r\\nPullman\\'s factory was poorly paid and difficult to acquire.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nReactions to these views appeared in two successive issues of the\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Advertentieblad.&lt;/i&gt; The first respondent, A&amp;dot; Van Ek, attempted to mute the\\r\\ncriticisms, arguing that although employment might not be available in the\\r\\nPullman works, ambitious people could always find employment elsewhere.\\r\\nHe further suggested that too many immigrants imagined America a land of\\r\\neasy success. Van Ek reserved his harshest attack for De Jong\\'s advice to\\r\\n\"remain where you are if you are doing well\":\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Why did you come to America? For no other reason than to\\r\\nimprove your lot &amp;mdash; right? Or did you have it good? If one does not&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"65\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;expect to improve his situation, then of course, no one would leave\\r\\nthe land of his birth. Thus, your advice, to stay where you are if you\\r\\nare well satisfied, is totally useless advice.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D038\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAnother correspondent, Wietze Posthumus, launched a bristling\\r\\ndefense of Roseland:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Perhaps thorns do grow on De Jong\\'s path in place of roses, but\\r\\nI have seen absolutely no poverty here unless as a consequence of\\r\\nsickness or from the misuse of liquor. I will not lie, you must work\\r\\nhard here, but you also get good wages &amp;mdash; everywhere people earn\\r\\n$1.50 for ten hours of ordinary work, whereas you must work a\\r\\nwhole week in Friesland for the same wages. I will not deny that there\\r\\nare many people here without work, but that is not always the fault of\\r\\nthe employer; more likely it is the fault of the employee. There are folk\\r\\nall over the world who would rather be idle, and America is certainly\\r\\nno place for talkers who do little. Everyone who wants to work and is\\r\\nable can find work easily here in America, even though it cannot\\r\\nalways be found in Roseland; for in the last few years there has been\\r\\nan excess of immigrants in the area.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;So I will contradict De Jong and say: Come to America,\\r\\nbecause you can earn your bread here and that is not always the case\\r\\nin Friesland.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D039\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDe Jong could not allow such assaults to go unanswered.

I can\\'t understand how Van\\r\\nEk can speak of saving when people earn $1.25 per day while one\\r\\nmust pay $12.00 per month for rent. Is that any kind of a life &amp;mdash; with\\r\\njust $.70 per day left over &amp;mdash; and then having to support a wife and\\r\\nchildren?\"&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBecause of this, De Jong claimed, \"There are many here who would\\r\\ngladly return to the Netherlands, but they cannot because of simple\\r\\npoverty.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis debate occurred during one of America\\'s economic crises, and in\\r\\nall probability De Jong\\'s advice, at that moment, was sounder than the\\r\\noptimistic suggestions of his antagonists. But over the years, Chicago &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\nprovided steady opportunities for immigrants of all sorts; and for those\\r\\nwilling to endure temporary setbacks, the prospect of social and economic\\r\\nadvance was solid.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D040\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;From Chicago to Texas and Back&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNonetheless, Dutch immigrants in Chicago retained an abiding\\r\\ninterest in rural opportunities. So it\\'s not surprising that speculators\\r\\nattempted to lure the urbanites with promises of inexpensive but fertile land\\r\\nin the far west. In 1894, for example, a committee of successful Dutch\\r\\nAmericans led by J&amp;dot; Broekema, a Chicago businessman, encouraged\\r\\nsettlement on land near Alvin, Texas.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"67\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I26.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nH&amp;dot; Koopman, an immigrant from Borger in Drenthe, who had found\\r\\nwork in Chicago as a gardener, was much intrigued by reports of Texas. He\\r\\nhad heard that in this agricultural paradise \"most crops can be raised twice a\\r\\nyear on the same land, even including potatoes.\" And, as he perceived it,\\r\\nhis own success was further insured by the fact that American farmers were\\r\\nlazy and careless. \"They till the soil poorly here,\" he wrote. \"All they do is\\r\\nplow the land, and they rummage around in the soil like pigs, and then they\\r\\nflatten it with a harrow. Most farmers in this country are lazy. They don\\'t\\r\\neven work for a third of the year.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nTempted by publicity, Koopman made the one-thousand-mile train\\r\\ntrip to Texas in 1898, but after observing the new colony, he returned to\\r\\nChicago, denouncing the whole venture as misguided. The promoters, he\\r\\nsaid, were worse than Judas Iscariot, for that betrayer had at least returned\\r\\nthe blood money. Koopman then exiled himself from all Dutch\\r\\nassociations &amp;mdash; the church, the Dutch consul, and the Dutch language\\r\\nnewspapers which had publicized the Texas venture.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nReporting his experience to a nephew in Borger, Koopman wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Two Dutch ministers sent many of their members to Texas\\r\\nwhere they had 5,000 acres belonging to a Holland organization.\\r\\nThey put out a booklet saying that it was a land flowing with milk\\r\\nand honey. Four Dutch ministers and a leading man in a large\\r\\nbusiness signed the booklet. I went to see Dominie Dykstra and asked\\r\\nhim many questions because he had seen the settlement and I was\\r\\ninterested in going there. So, I took the trip, but when I got to the last&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"68\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;stop on the railroad line, I had to stay overnight in a hotel: the\\r\\nsettlement was still twenty-five miles away, with no railway\\r\\nconnections.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;On the following day I started walking to the\\r\\nsettlement.... When I saw it, I said to them, \"The land is on a\\r\\nlevel with the sea (the Gulf of Mexico), and when the sea comes up\\r\\nyou will be flooded.\" They need steam plows to break up the land;\\r\\nthe people were killing themselves. I lived there for two days on\\r\\npancakes and coffee &amp;mdash; they had no bread and not one piece of meat,\\r\\nnot even beans. I went away hungry, found a hotel in Alvin where I\\r\\ngot a good dinner, and took the train back to Chicago.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nUpon returning to Chicago, Koopman visited Dominie Dykstra and\\r\\ndiscovered that the minister had never actually visited the colony, but had\\r\\ngone only as far as Alvin.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nKoopman reported:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Then the minister had to ask me what kind of place Liverpool\\r\\nwas and what I thought of it. I told him that it was poor for\\r\\nagriculture, and that with high water from the Gulf all would be\\r\\nflooded and that the people would be poverty-stricken and come back\\r\\nto Chicago. Within one year that is what happened. They were driven\\r\\noff by high water and they lost everything. They had to come back\\r\\nhome begging.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAfter that Koopman found work as a streetcar conductor, and,\\r\\nalthough isolated from the Dutch &lt;lacuna&gt; community, he continued to\\r\\nreport glowingly of Chicago and its opportunities. In 1920 he wrote, \"If you\\r\\nwere here in Chicago, your eyes would pop out.\" Koopman\\'s brother had\\r\\nwritten that their ancestral village in Drenthe was growing rapidly, but the\\r\\nnew Chicagoan was not much impressed:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Chicago has houses one next to the other from twenty to thirty\\r\\nstories high.... They have foundations thirty feet under the ground\\r\\nand they have entrances like the gates of cities. You must not compare\\r\\nstreets here to those in Holland. Here they are eighteen feet wide on\\r\\nboth sides, and four vehicles can easily pass each other. You can also\\r\\nsee the elevated train built on metal posts, and the trains fly past one\\r\\nanother to the west, south, and north. Lake Michigan is on the east\\r\\nside.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nKoopman never returned to the Dutch-American community, but he\\r\\nmaintained strong loyalties with his family in the Netherlands. After his\\r\\nretirement he wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I am in good health, and live in pleasant circumstances. I don\\'t\\r\\nwork any longer. I have a furnished apartment on the Boulevard, and\\r\\nI go where I wish for pleasure. If I were in the Netherlands, they&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"69\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;would tax me heavily because I am worth 30,000 guilders [i&amp;dot;e&amp;dot;,\\r\\n$15,000]. Now I would be most pleased if you would write to me\\r\\nand tell me who is still living and in what circumstances you find\\r\\nyourselves. I do not have much time left on the earth, and I do not\\r\\nwish to have my money divided among strangers when my time to die\\r\\ncomes. I would be pleased to have you or your children think of me\\r\\nafter my death, so I hope that you will write me quickly.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWith such incentives, Koopman\\'s Chicago address was probably\\r\\ncarefully preserved in Borger.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D041\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Klaas Niemeijer: A Typical Immigrant&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nKoopman\\'s experience in Chicago was not typical. Most Dutch\\r\\nimmigrants remained in their ethnic communities, finding comfort from\\r\\ntheir churches and pleasure in the company of their own people. Klaas\\r\\nNiemeijer, who immigrated in 1904, followed this more familiar pattern.\\r\\nThe Niemeijers traveled directly to Chicago, where they found temporary\\r\\nshelter with another Dutch family. Within four days they had rented an\\r\\napartment at seven dollars per month and Niemeijer had begun work as a\\r\\nteamster, hauling trash from Chicago at ten dollars per week.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe Niemeijers remained in the \"Groninger\\'s Hoek\" for six years,\\r\\nsettling into the community. Their children attended the Holland school,\\r\\nfor which Niemeijer paid $1.50 per month. The family attended the Dutch\\r\\nchurch, enjoyed sermons in their native tongue, and drank coffee with\\r\\nfellow parishioners after the services. They traveled to other Dutch\\r\\nneighborhoods in the city to meet acquaintances and friends from the\\r\\nNetherlands, and they read the Dutch-language newspaper, &lt;i&gt;Onze Toekomst,&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\nwhich informed them of events in the Netherlands as well as in America.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1907 Klaas Niemeijer was able to make a proud announcement. He\\r\\nhad become a farmer, the realization of a long-term objective. Before\\r\\ncoming to America Niemeijer had immigrated to Germany and had\\r\\naccumulated some capital by working in a coal mine. He had used that cash\\r\\nto establish a pig farm in the Netherlands, but disease had killed off his\\r\\nherd. With the balance of his money he bought passage to America. Thus,\\r\\nin 1907, when he finally achieved his goal, Klaas wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We no longer live in Chicago, but close by &amp;mdash; about three hours\\r\\nfrom the center of the city, or about twenty minutes from the city\\r\\nline.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We have rented 40 acres here for $130 annually &amp;mdash; that is 20\\r\\nacres of crop land, and 20 acres of pasture. A house comes with the\\r\\nfarm and it costs nothing extra. The streetcar is about five minutes\\r\\nfrom our door, and we take it to go to church, which is about a half\\r\\nhour away from us &amp;mdash; it is a Dutch church. Our children go to the\\r\\nEnglish school now which is about 10 rods (50 steps) off from our\\r\\nhouse. There are 10 or 11 Holland families here and we all rent our\\r\\nfarms.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"70\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;A German Jew lived here before us, and we bought from him\\r\\ntwo horses, a cow, and a wagon for $80. For $15 we bought hay,\\r\\nthree plows, a harrow, a sowing machine, but they are not worth\\r\\nmuch &amp;mdash; a pitch fork which is also worth little. Also ten chickens, and\\r\\nthen still more odds and ends. All of this we bought from the Jew,\\r\\nwho also lives in this house, and now he must move so we can move\\r\\nin. For all this we paid $550. Now we are farmers.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNiemeijer worked his garden farm for ten years, bringing crops to the\\r\\nChicago market two or three times each week. For fertilizer, he hauled free\\r\\nmanure from the Chicago stockyards. But, as the city grew to the west, his\\r\\nland was sold and Niemeijer turned to wholesaling. He bought celery from\\r\\nDutch farmers in western Michigan and transported it to Chicago for resale.\\r\\nDuring that period he moved back into the Dutch community on Chicago\\'s\\r\\nwest side. Finally, when he was too old to care for himself, Klaas lived with\\r\\nhis daughter in suburban Hinsdale, where she had married a farmer named\\r\\nSchooneveld.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1953, when Klaas was 88 years old, he proudly reported, \"I believe\\r\\nthat I have 30 grandchildren and 40 great-grandchildren, therefore quite a\\r\\ngroup.\" His children had scattered somewhat, but for the most part they\\r\\nlived nearby. One son, two hundred miles off, lived in Muskegon,\\r\\nMichigan, among other Dutch-Americans. Thus, there were no serious\\r\\nbreaches in the ethnic web.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNiemeijer\\'s life followed familiar patterns carved from the\\r\\nopportunities embedded in the character of the Dutch settlements of the\\r\\nChicago area. His personal history was duplicated by many others on both\\r\\nthe south and west sides of the city. These social-economic configurations,\\r\\nobviously similar to those in western Michigan, were also established by\\r\\nDutch-Americans in Wisconsin.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"71\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D042\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div2 name=\"Chapter 4 Settlements in Wisconsin\" type=\"chapter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;W&lt;/b&gt;isconsin, often called \"America\\'s Dairyland,\" is a famous\\r\\nproducer of dairy products, especially cheese. It has been\\r\\nestimated that, much like the Netherlands, the state contains\\r\\nabout one cow for every two persons. Long before this\\r\\ncharacteristic became evident, however, Wisconsin attracted the attention of\\r\\nprospective Dutch immigrants. H&amp;dot; P&amp;dot; Scholte was fleetingly drawn to\\r\\nWisconsin, and A&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Van Raalte had firm intentions of settling there.\\r\\nDissuaded from these plans by fears of adverse influences from the German\\r\\nCatholic populace which had gathered in Wisconsin, Van Raalte selected a\\r\\ntotally unsettled region in western Michigan. While others did not share\\r\\nVan Raalte\\'s fears, no leader of either Scholte\\'s or Van Raalte\\'s stature\\r\\nsettled in Wisconsin.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Why Not Michigan?&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nPeter Zonne, one of Scholte\\'s disciples, led a group of Zeelanders to\\r\\nWisconsin in 1847. Reports of sickness and hardship in Van Raalte\\'s\\r\\nHolland colony convinced Zonne to avoid Michigan and select an area near\\r\\nthe port of Sheboygan in Wisconsin. Several Dutch families had preceded\\r\\nhim to Wisconsin. One of these, the Peter Baden family, emigrated in 1844.\\r\\nExplaining why he did not settle in Michigan, Baden said:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Van Raalte\\'s colony is located in the state of Michigan. Many\\r\\nHollanders are located there, and it is a shame that he has put them\\r\\nin that place. The ministers there are even worse than they are in the\\r\\nNetherlands. They make laws upon laws to get money out of the\\r\\npeople\\'s pockets, but ordinary American laws are good enough for us.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"72\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I27.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"73\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We came here to be free, and not to be ruled by tyrants again. The\\r\\nministers only came here to get rich and to make servants of the\\r\\ninnocent and simple-minded Dutch immigrants. On top of all that\\r\\nMichigan is such an unhealthy land that many people die. People\\r\\nthere can never make much progress because they have to consume\\r\\neverything they raise. Thus there is no prosperity there. [A certain\\r\\nMr&amp;dot;] Baunt is also there, but he has written that he is coming here as\\r\\nsoon as the ice breaks, making the lake navigable. He will come to us\\r\\nhere in Wisconsin, but first he must sell his land. That is not easy\\r\\nbecause the ministers control the buying and selling of land in the\\r\\ncolony. If people make a profit from land sales, they have to turn it\\r\\nover to the ministers. That is a law passed by the ministers in\\r\\nHolland, Michigan, but it is not the law of the land.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D043\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Milwaukee: A Withered Transplant&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWithout ministerial leadership, a significant number of Dutch\\r\\nimmigrants had settled in the Milwaukee area. In 1851 Gijsbert van\\r\\nSteenwijk reported the presence of nearly eight hundred Dutch-Americans\\r\\nin that area. Van Steenwijk was well-educated and stood aloof from the\\r\\nDutch community that had begun to develop in Milwaukee. He described\\r\\nthem as \"poor and in many respects backward, but nonetheless honest and\\r\\nhardworking.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBy 1856 Dutch immigrants, occupying the northwest section of the\\r\\ncity, had created a neighborhood marked by solid homes and a church.\\r\\nJacob Quintus, editor of the Sheboygan &lt;i&gt;Nieuwsbode,&lt;/i&gt; wrote, \"They have seen\\r\\ntheir efforts crowned with excellent results. The miserable shanties in which\\r\\nthey have lived for a half dozen years have made way for excellent buildings,\\r\\nand still the Hollanders are forging ahead.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nObviously, an ethnic community of this sort with connected rural\\r\\nsettlements near the fringes of the city could have provided an ethnic\\r\\ncorridor for geographic mobility. In the Milwaukee area, however, the lure\\r\\nof the city surpassed that of the farm, and by the 1890s the nearby rural\\r\\ncommunities had been absorbed into the city. Ultimately the Dutch ethnic\\r\\ncommunity in Milwaukee disintegrated.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe history of Milwaukee\\'s Dutch community is clearly illustrated in\\r\\nthe experience of P&amp;dot; Lankester, who emigrated from Veere, Zeeland, in\\r\\n1849. Lankester settled in Franklin Prairie, fifteen miles outside of\\r\\nMilwaukee, and from the outset, he demonstrated an ambitious perception\\r\\nof Milwaukee\\'s economic opportunities. Although a baker, he was quick to\\r\\nrecognize other opportunities. In 1850 he noted that the city of Milwaukee\\r\\nhad no starch factory, although the ingredients needed to manufacture the\\r\\nproduct were available at low prices. Because he was not familiar with the\\r\\nmethods for making starch, he asked his brother in Veere to provide\\r\\ndetailed instructions explaining the starch-making procedures used in the\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"74\"&gt;\\r\\nNetherlands. Seventeen years later Lankester sought his brother\\'s assistance\\r\\nin acquiring the plans for a potato-peeling machine. Lankester\\'s housemaid,\\r\\na recent immigrant from Amsterdam, had reported that such a machine was\\r\\nbeing used in her native city. Lankester hoped to acquire a drawing of the\\r\\nmachine and intended to patent the invention in America, where, he\\r\\nwrote, \"Hand labor is too expensive to peel potatoes, and in general people\\r\\nare too lazy to peel them by hand, and thus unpeeled potatoes are served on\\r\\nthe tables.\" He did not expect to manufacture the machine, but rather to\\r\\nacquire an income from patent rights.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D044\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nLankester did not depend on such opportunistic ventures for his\\r\\nlivelihood. He diligently pursued his trade as a baker. From Franklin Prairie,\\r\\nwhere he lived on a farm and operated his bakery, Lankester made regular\\r\\ntrips to Milwaukee. Of his bakery he wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Bread is made (here) from the purest white flour, the finest\\r\\nkind you can buy at $4 a barrel.

Because if one thing doesn\\'t\\r\\nwork, people quickly turn to something else. Here there is not the\\r\\nleast difference between farmers, city dwellers, or gentlemen. People,\\r\\nfrom the poorest day laborer to the President, are addressed \"Mr&amp;dot;\"&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D047\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThroughout his correspondence between 1850 and 1867, Lankester\\r\\nfrequently advised prospective immigrants of the great opportunities for\\r\\ncarpenters, bricklayers, and other tradesmen in Milwaukee. And his own\\r\\nbusiness was probably not hindered by moving to the city. In any case,\\r\\nwhen Lankester and his neighbors deserted Franklin Prairie, the most viable\\r\\nopportunity for constructing a combined rural-urban ethnic complex in the\\r\\nMilwaukee area also disappeared. Commemorating fifty years of Dutch\\r\\nsettlement in Wisconsin, J&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; Karsten said:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;In spite of every economic and other advantage, Franklin\\r\\nPrairie never became a thriving Dutch settlement. The population\\r\\nsoon began to decrease and is still decreasing so that at the present\\r\\nmoment not more than twenty families remain. The settlement thus\\r\\nappears to be threatened by early extinction. One reason for this\\r\\ndecline is the lack of the consistent preaching of the gospel. Without\\r\\nthis advantage, the Dutch settler was not likely to be drawn to any\\r\\nsettlement.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I28.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"76\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe only other Dutch settlement near Milwaukee suffered a similar\\r\\nfate. Town Eight, or Bethlehem, organized in 1847, enjoyed the ministry of\\r\\nDominie H&amp;dot; Budding for a short time. Budding, who had first joined a small\\r\\ngroup of immigrants in Ravenna, Michigan, drifted from there to Town\\r\\nEight, and later to the east coast. Gerhardus Brandt became the lay pastor\\r\\nof the Town Eight congregation in 1854, with a salary of $100. But following\\r\\nthe death of his wife in 1856, Brandt married a young widow who owned a\\r\\n20-acre farm. Something about this development irritated the congregation,\\r\\nand Brandt gave up his ministerial duties to become a farmer. Perhaps the\\r\\ncongregation interpreted his marriage to a wealthy widow seventeen years\\r\\nyounger than himself as somewhat opportunistic.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSummarizing these events, G&amp;dot; Brandt\\'s daughter exclaimed, \"There\\r\\nare already many religious divisions among the Hollanders in America.\" At\\r\\nany rate, Town Eight, which numbered only thirty families in 1857, was\\r\\nunable to retain the services of G&amp;dot; Brandt and found no one to replace him.\\r\\nLater, when the open spaces around the village attracted non-Dutch\\r\\nsettlers, the Netherlanders drifted away.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D048\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Sheboygan: A Lasting Community&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDuring these same years another Dutch-American community had\\r\\ndeveloped in the Sheboygan area, fifty miles north of Milwaukee. That\\r\\ncommunity, which still exists today, shares characteristics with the Dutch-American\\r\\ncommunities of western Michigan and the Chicago area.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe first Dutch families who arrived in Sheboygan County (between\\r\\n1845 and 1847) were devoted farmers. After purchasing parcels of\\r\\nWisconsin\\'s virgin forest, they began to cut and haul the lumber to ports\\r\\nsuch as Sheboygan and Milwaukee. These cities provided markets for both\\r\\nthe lumber and the agricultural products that the settlers had begun to raise\\r\\namong the tree stumps. Most of these immigrants were poor and sought\\r\\nadditional work for cash. The city of Sheboygan, which had been settled by\\r\\n1834, offered some opportunities for day laborers; but it was little more than\\r\\na village and could not sustain so large a work force as Chicago or Grand\\r\\nRapids. Thus the Dutch-American community in Wisconsin did not extend\\r\\nmuch beyond Sheboygan County. Still, because Sheboygan provided\\r\\nemployment in mills and on the docks, the urban-rural pattern did develop\\r\\nthere. By the 1870s the town also acquired factories. So a number of\\r\\nimmigrants who worked in Milwaukee moved to Sheboygan. Others were\\r\\ndrawn from temporary employment in eastern cities such as Buffalo and\\r\\nRochester, New York.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWithin one decade Sheboygan County immigrants had established\\r\\nfour rural towns, and several families had also settled in the port city. The\\r\\nexperience of Graadus Heinen, who immigrated from Aalten in 1854, was\\r\\nprobably typical. He traveled directly to Sheboygan, where he found lodging\\r\\nwith his brother-in-law. Heinen began working immediately, claiming that\\r\\nhis salary for one day\\'s work equalled that of a whole week\\'s wage in the\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"77\"&gt;\\r\\nNetherlands. Food, and meat particularly, he declared, was so inexpensive\\r\\nthat \"we never lived better than this in the Netherlands.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nShortly after immigrating, Heinen rented an eighty-acre farm on a\\r\\nseven-year lease. Twenty acres of the land had been cleared, and he was\\r\\nable to pay his rent by selling lumber from the uncleared land. For extra\\r\\ncash he hired himself out to neighboring farmers. In one instance, Heinen\\r\\nreported, an American farmer paid him a dollar per day plus food and\\r\\nlodging. While there Heinen reported, \"I ate as good as the best citizen in\\r\\nAalten.\" Further, he enjoyed the service of a Dutch church and the\\r\\ncompany of his brother, Abraham, who lived a half hour\\'s distance away.\\r\\nHeinen proudly announced the purchase of milk cows, oxen, and farm\\r\\nmachinery. He asserted, \"We cannot thank the Lord enough for having sent\\r\\nus to North America, because we have a good and blessed life here.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D049\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHowever, by 1859 opportunities for penniless immigrants decreased.\\r\\nC&amp;dot; Snoeyenbosch, who had been a resident of Sheboygan County for twelve\\r\\nyears, offered detailed advice to a prospective immigrant in Winterswijk:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;You ask how things go here for someone who comes with little\\r\\nor no money. Dear nephew, for such people there is no prospect of\\r\\nowning land, especially if they must support a family, because the\\r\\nland which we bought 12 years ago for fl&amp;dot; 12 per acre costs fl&amp;dot; 57\\r\\ntoday.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;But, we don\\'t think it will be difficult for you. If you have a\\r\\nhealthy body, you can earn enough here to buy a small piece of&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I29.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"78\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I30.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;ground quickly. You can earn three times as much here as by you,\\r\\ndespite the fact that wages are presently low here.... In winter\\r\\nthere is little work here, but you can make wooden shoes.... They\\r\\nare made from linden wood which is easy to work and costs little or\\r\\nno money. It is true, it would be better if there were fewer wooden-shoe\\r\\nmakers here, but we have talked to our brother-in-law who has a\\r\\nstore which sells many wooden shoes. He will take them from you if\\r\\nthey are well made... but make sure that you take good tools\\r\\nalong, because they are not available here.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSnoeyenbosch offered hearty encouragement to his nephew, urging\\r\\nhim to come to Wisconsin. But for those who wished to become large\\r\\nindependent farmers, he had other advice. He suggested that they immigrate\\r\\nto Iowa, Minnesota, or other less-settled areas. Sheboygan County was\\r\\nalready beginning to fill up. In 1852, according to Dominie P&amp;dot; Zonne, it\\r\\nalready had two hundred farmsteads covering about six thousand acres. Jacob\\r\\nQuintus, editor of the &lt;i&gt;Sheboygan Nieuwsbode,&lt;/i&gt; reported a large influx of new\\r\\nimmigrants in the mid-50s&amp;dot; Land was still available in the Sheboygan area,\\r\\nbut the prices were rising rapidly. Thus, opportunities for the poorest\\r\\nimmigrants had begun to dwindle.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSnoeyenbosch\\'s advice &amp;mdash; to seek less-expensive land in the west &amp;mdash; was\\r\\nwell-founded. Many immigrants moved from Wisconsin, Michigan, and\\r\\nelsewhere to Minnesota and Iowa. From Iowa they trekked to South Dakota,\\r\\nNebraska, and Kansas. They were not merely content to provide for\\r\\nthemselves, but were also anxious to secure farms for their sons and\\r\\ngrandsons.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"79\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I31.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe search for fertile but inexpensive land continued until the turn of\\r\\nthe century. The immigrants\\' sons and grandsons, as well as new arrivals,\\r\\nwrote constantly about the cost and availability of farmland. Many were\\r\\nwilling to reestablish themselves when prospects seemed more attractive\\r\\nelsewhere, but they seldom set up housekeeping beyond the reach of other\\r\\nDutch-Americans and their churches. Roelof Brinks, who had immigrated\\r\\nfrom Emmen in 1853, moved to Orange City, Iowa, after working and\\r\\nfarming in Michigan for twenty-six years. In 1879 Brinks reported that he\\r\\nhad moved to Orange City because the land in Michigan was too expensive\\r\\nfor his children. And, he added, \"Iowa is all prairie, has no trees and is very\\r\\npleasant. The soil is very fertile. We have 240 acres and I have already sold\\r\\nmy land in Michigan.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nJohn Brinks, Roelof\\'s brother, had moved to Iowa eight years earlier.\\r\\nRoelof wrote, \"John has 120 acres which our children will inherit, because\\r\\nhe is unmarried and has no children.\" Then three years later Roelof offered\\r\\nadditional advice to his family in Drenthe, pointing them to a new\\r\\nsettlement 140 miles westward in South Dakota where \"you can get 160\\r\\nacres for almost nothing under the Homestead Laws. It is not yet populated,\\r\\nbut it looks like a good future for people who are willing to work.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThus the word was out. Land in the Great Plains states could provide\\r\\nhomes for the poorest immigrants. The drama could be reenacted.\\r\\nImmigrants who had temporarily settled in Michigan, Illinois, and\\r\\nWisconsin, together with a host of new arrivals, moved through Pella to\\r\\nwestern Iowa, South Dakota, and beyond.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"81\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D050\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div2 name=\"Chapter 5 Farming in the West\" type=\"chapter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;s the midwestern colonies became crowded, many immigrants\\r\\nlooked further west. Dutch immigrants joined their new\\r\\ncountrymen in a headlong rush for land whenever new regions\\r\\nbecame available. And as more immigrants flooded into the\\r\\ncountry, looking for fertile soil, the United States government, both by war\\r\\nand treaty, pushed the native Americans into undesirable areas. Between\\r\\n1850 and 1900 literally hundreds of immigrant villages dotted the western\\r\\nlandscape.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe treeless prairies and plains offered opportunities quite different\\r\\nfrom those in the woodlands of Michigan and Wisconsin. On the prairie\\r\\nimmigrants were able to cultivate their land immediately. Also, unlike the\\r\\nconstruction of log homes in the north, building sod houses required few\\r\\nspecial skills.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBut these prairie settlers also faced unique difficulties. Fuel was scarce;\\r\\nmany immigrants resorted to burning woven bundles of prairie grass or\\r\\nimported coal. Also, the weather was unpredictable: wind storms, carrying\\r\\nsnow or dust, brought extensive hardship and damage. And prairie fires,\\r\\nfanned by strong winds, caused frequent anxiety and occasional disaster.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDespite these difficulties, Netherlanders emigrated to the West\\r\\nregularly between 1847 and 1920. Other Dutch-Americans, lured from the\\r\\ncities and smaller farms of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Illinois, soon joined\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThese settlers established communities in which almost every activity\\r\\nsupported the needs of the farmer. Agriculture fosters relatively sparse\\r\\npatterns of population, especially when each farmer cultivates parcels\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"82\"&gt;\\r\\naveraging 160 acres or more. Thus, Dutch villages like Pella and Orange\\r\\nCity in Iowa never became thickly populated commercial centers. Trade\\r\\nroutes passed through these towns on the way to Chicago and St&amp;dot; Louis, but\\r\\nthe farmer\\'s convenience restricted the growth of the country village. To\\r\\nsucceed, the banks, mills, and churches of these places had to be located\\r\\nwithin convenient reach. Farmers located up to twelve miles from town\\r\\ncould make a round trip to the mill or blacksmith in one day with a horse\\r\\nand wagon. When settlers located beyond the twelve-mile range, towns\\r\\nwith churches and other institutions sprang up within the newly occupied\\r\\nregions. These forces scattered the Dutch-American community across the\\r\\nlandscape in small village-oriented concentrations.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Iowa: The Richest Soil&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1847 Pella became the first Dutch colony across the Mississippi\\r\\nRiver. Scholte and his followers selected that site for several reasons. First,\\r\\nand most important, they were convinced of its agricultural potential. But\\r\\nthey were also influenced by its location: the town was built on a road\\r\\nleading to markets in Keukuk. And it was near the Des Moines River,\\r\\nthought to be a potential trade route to St&amp;dot; Louis and the Mississippi River.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlthough the land lived up to their expectations, its location never\\r\\npaid off for these Netherlanders. They soon discovered that the distance\\r\\nbetween Pella and the markets of Keukuk &amp;mdash; approximately 120 miles &amp;mdash; was\\r\\ntoo far to make business there a realistic option. Also, attempts to improve\\r\\nand use the Des Moines River never succeeded. Pella remained an isolated\\r\\ncolony until railroads reached the area in 1866.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFrom its inception, Pella, with its treeless surroundings, provided an\\r\\nalternative to Van Raalte\\'s colony amid the Michigan forests. Settlers in\\r\\neach location sought information with which to compare the relative\\r\\nsuccess of the two settlements. Thus, in 1849 H&amp;dot; Van Eijk from Holland,\\r\\nMichigan, urged his friend H&amp;dot; Van Asselt to \"write about Rev&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; P&amp;dot; Scholte\\r\\nand his colony.\" For Van Eijk said, \"They do not speak well of it here. But I\\r\\nsincerely hope that these reports are all lies.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D051\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt is not evident that Van Asselt ever visited Pella, although it seems\\r\\nthat he immigrated with intentions of joining the Scholte venture. He and\\r\\nVan Eijk probably met during their travels from Europe and apparently were\\r\\nacquainted with another young man, G&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; Meyer, who &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; settle in Pella.\\r\\nBoth Van Asselt and Van Eijk had heard negative reports about Pella, and\\r\\nMeyer sought to correct these misrepresentations in an 1848 letter to Van\\r\\nAsselt:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I am pleased that you have asked me to report concerning our\\r\\ncolony because some people look down upon it. But they entirely\\r\\nmisrepresent Pella. Some people who moved back to St&amp;dot; Louis have\\r\\nmade themselves unworthy of Pella, and now, to justify having left,\\r\\nthey do nothing but belittle and slander our beloved servant of Jesus&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"83\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Christ, Rev&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; P&amp;dot; Scholte.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Now, friend, I will respond to your question. Carpenters have\\r\\na lot of work here, and they earn a dollar per day. Brickmasons earn\\r\\nthat same wage, but they have less work as there are not many bricks\\r\\nhere yet. There is not much work for painters because we have as yet\\r\\ntoo few nice houses. Work is beginning to improve for tailors, and it is\\r\\nalso good for shoemakers. There is much work here for the blacksmith\\r\\nand wheelmaker. Laborers earn fifty cents per day working from 7\\r\\nA&amp;dot;M&amp;dot; to 6 P&amp;dot;M&amp;dot; &amp;mdash; and work of all sorts is becoming more available.\\r\\nAt first there was not much work here, and even farmers had too\\r\\nlittle. One reason for that is because there is less wood to be cut here\\r\\nthan in other colonies. But, even though the prairies and farmlands\\r\\nare without forests, the countryside is beautiful. The roads are good\\r\\nenough for transportation, but we have not yet harvested a crop&lt;/i&gt;&lt;note ref=\"1\"&gt;1 &lt;i&gt;Meyer\\'s letter is dated June 20, 1848, and the Scholte group did not arrive in Pella until August\\r\\n1847.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;i&gt;to\\r\\nuse them.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;If you had come here with us, you could have had a good job\\r\\nhelping a doctor, and then your trust in Scholte would not be\\r\\nshaken....

I want to tell you this: I have written only the truth, and I\\r\\naffirm again that it is reasonably favorable for all classes of people\\r\\nhere. And, when you consider how short a time we have been here,\\r\\nwe must be thankful for prayers answered beyond our expectations.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D052\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDuring the succeeding decades, Pella became an increasingly\\r\\nattractive and thriving community. An immigrant who visited Scholte\\'s\\r\\ncolony in 1887 wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Pella is a city of trees. Among the trees that adorn the city are\\r\\nmany fruit trees.... Pella and its environs is a land of corn and\\r\\nswine. The corn harvest is immense, and hogs are raised by the\\r\\nthousands. They are shipped live to Chicago where they are processed\\r\\nby the big meat packing companies. Herds of beef cattle are also sent\\r\\nto the market from Pella.... Farmers are proud of their cattle and\\r\\nconstantly seek to improve the breed. They even import cattle from\\r\\nFrance and Norway.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nLong before 1887, however, land prices near Pella had risen sharply,\\r\\nand newly arriving immigrants tended to bypass Scholte\\'s colony in favor of\\r\\nless-expensive land further west. Already in 1869 a group of Pella\\'s residents\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"84\"&gt;\\r\\ntraveled westward in search of unsettled land which could be acquired from\\r\\nthe government. They located rich soil in Sioux County near Iowa\\'s\\r\\nnorthwestern border. Sioux County was three hundred miles west of Pella, a\\r\\ndistance that effectively destroyed daily interrelationships between the new\\r\\ncolony and its parent. Thus, in 1870, when these settlers established\\r\\nOrange City, they quickly organized a church and the essential businesses\\r\\nconnected with agricultural activity.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis process was reenacted time and again during the nineteenth and\\r\\nearly twentieth centuries: more than one hundred similar Dutch colonies\\r\\nwere established across the Mississippi River. Westward they stretched to the\\r\\nPacific Ocean. From Texas they extended northward into Canada. Many of\\r\\nthese colonies failed, and none of them became large urban centers. But\\r\\nthose that succeeded survived as small rural communities serving an\\r\\nagricultural clientele.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D053\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nLand attracted these pioneers, vast stretches of unclaimed land that\\r\\ncould be acquired under the Homestead Laws enacted in 1862. Using this\\r\\nlegislation, a family could gain title to 160 acres by merely occupying and\\r\\ncultivating their holdings for five years. This opportunity came too late for\\r\\nthe founders of Pella, but Dutch settlers who moved into Sioux County took\\r\\nfull advantage of the Homestead Laws, acquiring 24,320 acres in 1869.\\r\\nDescribing that area as it appeared to him in 1872, E&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; G&amp;dot; Bloemendaal,\\r\\nwho immigrated from Gorssel, wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;When we stood on top of the low hills and viewed the area in\\r\\nthe region surrounding Orange City, the landscape was simply\\r\\nbewitching. The land was a rolling prairie with gradual inclines and\\r\\ndeclines rising and falling 40 or 50 feet over a quarter mile\\'s\\r\\ndistance.... The soil is so rich that it needs no fertilizer for the first\\r\\n20 years. It is neither clay nor sand. They call it muck. It is not\\r\\nheavy and can be worked easily with a team of horses. The soil is\\r\\ncomposed of decayed grass which has accumulated year after year for\\r\\ncenturies and is entirely unlike that found in Europe.

Soon the growing stream of\\r\\nDutch immigrants was forced to move to other parts of the county,\\r\\nestablishing additional towns. Sioux Center originated in 1871, Hospers in\\r\\n1873, Maurice in 1884, and Hull in 1895. In South Dakota, just over the\\r\\nBig Sioux River, additional Dutch settlements sprang up in the 1880s; while\\r\\nNebraska, another neighboring state, had already attracted settlers from\\r\\nWisconsin in 1870. Nearly all these settlements were located on railroad\\r\\nlines, and each acquired its own Dutch church and essential business\\r\\nestablishments. When fully grown, the most successful of these villages\\r\\noffered a substantial range of useful services.

But the path to independent\\r\\nmeans was neither direct nor assured. For those with substantial resources,\\r\\nSioux County provided the most favorable opportunities for success. The\\r\\nquality of its soil and a generally reliable rainfall produced opulent crops\\r\\nyear after year. So it\\'s not surprising that land values have risen continually\\r\\nin Sioux County since 1870. When H&amp;dot; Beltman emigrated to Orange City\\r\\nin 1878 and acquired 160 acres of land for about $10 per acre, he probably\\r\\nnever imagined that the same land would sell for $2,500 per acre in 1977.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D055\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe Beltmans began their new life in Orange City under the most\\r\\nfavorable circumstances. Writing to his family in Winterswijk, Beltman\\r\\nexclaimed:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The land which our brother bought for us impressed us very\\r\\nwell, with good crops nearly ripe. The crops were almost worth as\\r\\nmuch as the price of the land. But we have been very busy because\\r\\nthe crops were ready to harvest. When we first came, we had to finish\\r\\nthe harvest and then build a house &amp;mdash; now we have built a good house.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Now things are looking very good to us. We have bought an\\r\\nextra 80-acre piece of ground for good measure, and it has both a\\r\\nhouse and a stable which cost us $800. We have rented it to some\\r\\nGelderlanders for one year at a third of the crops. Then we have\\r\\nanother 80 acres next to our land which we will till ourselves. That\\r\\ncost $700 without a house or stable. That land is located next to the\\r\\nplace where we have built our house.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We have three work horses: two of six years that are black and\\r\\nanother of five years which is brown. They cost $100 each. We also\\r\\nhave a wagon for $88 and two cows &amp;mdash; one for $26 and one for $27.\\r\\nWe still have three pigs after butchering three others.

Arriving\\r\\nin well-established Dutch-American communities, they were able to\\r\\nparticipate comfortably in familiar social and religious institutions. Hull,\\r\\nIowa, a village much like Orange City, was founded in 1895, and A&amp;dot;\\r\\nBrunsting, who settled there sometime after 1890, described that area for his\\r\\nbrother in Beilen, Drenthe. He wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"87\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The land here is nicely arranged. Every farm has enough hay\\r\\nand pasture to feed its own livestock, and the balance of the land is in\\r\\ncultivation. Most farms are of about 160 acres, and those who have\\r\\nthe chance rent another 80 or 160 acres in order to keep a hired hand\\r\\nbusy. Those like us with 120 acres can work the land without extra\\r\\nhelp.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D056\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1909 Brunsting enlarged on that description:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We live two and a half miles from Hull, thus not very far off.\\r\\nSome live six, seven, or eight miles from the city which makes it a\\r\\nlittle difficult to attend church twice on Sunday.

In the last few\\r\\nyears land has become expensive here, so that it has increased in price\\r\\nby about 50 percent&amp;dot; Land near the city has already gone for $125\\r\\nper acre. Last year I bought 80 acres about five miles from the city\\r\\nfor $97 per acre. Now I\\'ll tell you a little about our farm as you\\r\\nasked. We work about 300 acres per year, that with two boys. But it\\r\\nis impossible to describe everything to you &amp;mdash; how the machinery and\\r\\neverything else works. I hope sometime to be able to tell you in\\r\\nperson.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D057\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAmong large farmers like Brunsting, new immigrants could readily\\r\\nacquire positions as hired hands or housemaids. Their wages were relatively\\r\\nhigh, and they were able to accumulate capital for the eventual purchase of\\r\\ntheir own land and equipment. Herman Berghuis, for example, immigrated\\r\\nto Orange City, Iowa, in 1882. There he worked for B&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Grooters, who had\\r\\nimmigrated in 1866. Berghuis contracted for eight months\\' work at $70 with\\r\\nroom and board, and, since he was inexperienced, he considered himself\\r\\nwell-paid. Of his prospects he wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;It is such here that people can progress better than in the\\r\\nNetherlands if they will work and if they enjoy the Lord\\'s blessing.\\r\\nAlso many people are going to Dakota, where you can get 160 acres\\r\\nfor $23. The land there is as fertile as here. The farmers have it much\\r\\nbetter here than by you and also the hired hands; thus one can\\r\\nbecome a farmer quickly here. If you have two horses, a plow, a\\r\\nwagon, a cultivator, and a mowing machine, you are ready to farm.\\r\\nIf I work here for two years, I will have more than if I worked for five\\r\\nyears in Holland. Every day we eat white bread with the boss &amp;mdash; and\\r\\nthat tastes good.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D058\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAnother young farm hand, G&amp;dot; van Nijhuis, found work in Sheldon,\\r\\nIowa, and urged a friend to join him in America. In 1889 he reported\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"88\"&gt;\\r\\nconfidentially that he had saved $8.25 in just one week, and although that\\r\\nwas extraordinary, he could expect an average income of $20 per month.\\r\\nMost importantly, Nijhuis claimed that he could save most of his wages\\r\\nbecause he only needed to pay cash for clothing and tobacco. Urging his\\r\\nfriend to join him in Iowa, Nijhuis promised:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;If you have the desire to come and can\\'t earn as much in one\\r\\nsummer as it costs for a round trip, I will give you the return passage.\\r\\nBut I have no worry about that. Once you come here you will be glad\\r\\nto stay.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFour years later, Nijhuis continued to encourage immigration:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Why don\\'t you come to this country? If you don\\'t like it you\\r\\ncan go back. There is demand for hired hands this fall if you have\\r\\nenough money to come. Don\\'t be afraid that you won\\'t get enough to\\r\\nreturn. I now earn $25 per month and $20 in the winter. I could go\\r\\nback to Holland every winter and still have twice as much left over as\\r\\nyou. The reason I don\\'t come back is not for fear of the ocean. I\\r\\ndon\\'t worry about that. But I worry about spending all my savings.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAvailable records do not demonstrate that Nijhuis visited the\\r\\nNetherlands, but if he did, it was probably to find a wife. In each of his\\r\\nletters he urged his friend to report \"how things stand with all the boys and\\r\\ngirls I know,\" and on one occasion he wrote, \"There are not very many girls\\r\\nhere.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nOthers, however, found the supply of Dutch girls very adequate. J&amp;dot;\\r\\nOosteralting declared that he would not return to Erm, Drenthe, to find a\\r\\ngirl because \"there are enough here in America, and most of them are Hollanders.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nYoung men like Nijhuis and Berghuis were certainly able to\\r\\naccumulate capital, but deciding where they could most successfully begin\\r\\nfarming was more complicated. They all recognized the outstanding fertility\\r\\nof Sioux County soil, but could not readily purchase the costly land of that\\r\\ndistrict. Thus, many moved and invested their savings in neighboring states.\\r\\nOf his friends Nijhuis reported that one had gone to Mexico, and another\\r\\nto Minnesota.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nJ&amp;dot; Brouwer, who immigrated from Andrijk in 1888, examined several\\r\\nlocations before selecting a permanent home in Iowa. His search began in\\r\\nRoseland, Illinois, which he found too expensive and crowded. He\\r\\ncomplained that the place he had rented for ten dollars per month didn\\'t\\r\\neven have enough space to raise a few potatoes. Within one year he moved\\r\\nto Orange City, Iowa, where he rented a fifteen-acre farm for fifteen dollars\\r\\nper month. But after a short time he found a larger farm of one hundred\\r\\nsixty acres. After consulting with several members of his family and the\\r\\nDominie, he purchased the farm and continued to cultivate it for eleven\\r\\nyears. Due to the rising value of Orange City land, Brouwer sold his farm at\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"89\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I33.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"map\"&gt;\\r\\na handsome profit in 1899. He then purchased a smaller eighty-acre farm in\\r\\nHornick and used the balance of his cash to pay off debts and provide\\r\\nassistance to each of his children.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn Hornick, only sixty miles south of Orange City, land sold for\\r\\ntwenty dollars per acre, while Brouwer\\'s farm had sold for forty-four dollars\\r\\nper acre. Hornick was an essentially American community; there Brouwer\\r\\njoined a small nucleus of twenty-four Dutch families who had also purchased\\r\\nthe inexpensive land of that region.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;South Dakota: Free Land&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFarms in South Dakota and Nebraska, however, could be acquired for\\r\\nmuch less money than those in Iowa. Immigrants who had little cash or\\r\\ncredit found these regions very attractive. Albert Kuipers, who immigrated\\r\\nto South Dakota in 1882, vigorously publicized the opportunities in that\\r\\nregion. Although born in poverty, he had farmed a small piece of heath\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"90\"&gt;\\r\\nland in Drenthe with some success. But after arriving in South Dakota, he\\r\\nwrote glowing reports of success in Charles Mix County, where he and his\\r\\nson had settled. The &lt;i&gt;Nieuw Advertentieblad&lt;/i&gt; in Friesland published Kuipers\\'s\\r\\naccount of Roelof Bartelds\\'s experience of 1888. Bartelds was the poorest\\r\\nimmigrant to accompany Kuipers to South Dakota. \"He was a poor peat\\r\\ndigger from Zuidwolde (Drenthe),\" who with his two children had to work a\\r\\nfull year to pay for their passage to America.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D059\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAfter working to pay off these debts, Bartelds, with Kuipers\\'s\\r\\nassistance, found a piece of open land. Kuipers wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;In the spring of 1882 Bartelds came to me and asked me if\\r\\nthere were any open lands in my neighborhood. I am in constant\\r\\ncommunication with the land office, and thus I always know what\\r\\nland is available. I showed him a piece of land near us in Platte Creek\\r\\nof about 160 acres for which he had to pay $15.50 to have it surveyed\\r\\nand registered. He is now a farmer on this 160 acres. He has a sod\\r\\nhouse there but also a wood stable and grainery. He has 64 acres\\r\\nunder cultivation and the rest in pasture and hay. He has four horses,\\r\\nseven cows, a number of pigs, and all the necessary farm machinery,\\r\\nincluding a self-binder which both cuts and binds. In short, he is a\\r\\ngood farmer.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;If you wish to write him, his address is R&amp;dot; Bartelds, P&amp;dot; O&amp;dot;&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I34.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"91\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Castalia, Charles Mix County, Dakota. Ask him with how much\\r\\nmoney he came here in 1882, and what he now has; how much he\\r\\nhas acquired from his farm this year, etc&amp;dot; Then you will hear directly\\r\\nfrom him how a poor laborer can progress, at least if he is willing to\\r\\nwork.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D060\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt is impossible to measure how much credibility prospective\\r\\nimmigrants allotted to Kuipers\\'s claims. The private reports of one brother\\r\\nto another probably carried far more authority. Ulbe Eringa, who\\r\\nimmigrated from Veldwijk in 1892, corresponded regularly with his family\\r\\nover twenty-five years, and such letters, passed from hand to hand, spread\\r\\ndetailed and reliable reports among Eringa\\'s family and friends.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDuring the summer of 1892, Eringa arrived in Hull, Iowa, where by\\r\\nprior arrangement he lived with a friend named Abma. Within a few days\\r\\nafter his arrival, \"A woman came riding up into the yard with two nice\\r\\nhorses and a wagon.\" This woman, Mrs&amp;dot; Hunt, had heard that a new Dutch\\r\\nfarmhand had arrived, and her husband needed help. Ulbe moved in with\\r\\nthis English family and wrote, \"They are real Americans and they speak\\r\\nEnglish, but it is very neat here and the people are very friendly.\" He\\r\\nbelieved that they were Christian people because they \"have five Bibles,\"\\r\\nbut, he continued, \"they don\\'t read them; that is not the custom here. Also\\r\\nthey don\\'t pray after meals. Mr&amp;dot; Hunt does say a small prayer before eating,\\r\\nbut I don\\'t understand him.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWithin a short time Eringa discovered a number of old acquaintances\\r\\nand friends in the neighborhood. In Orange City he met Johannes v&amp;dot; d&amp;dot;\\r\\nSchaaf, who had been a hired hand for Ulbe\\'s uncle in Friesland. Then, \"to\\r\\nmy surprise,\" he wrote, \"Hedser Reipstra lives a half hour off from me. He is\\r\\nan old friend of mine.... He lives with a big farmer and even owns an\\r\\nAmerican carriage. He may use the farmer\\'s horses for nothing, and I have\\r\\nridden with him three times already when he has taken me to church.\"\\r\\nWell satisfied with his new life, Eringa said, \"I am very much at home here,\\r\\nand I can hardly imagine that I am in America.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe activities of the Dutch church constantly attracted Ulbe, and\\r\\nover the years he supported its growth with time and money. In 1892 he\\r\\nattended a church in nearby Sioux Center and wrote, \"I almost forgot that I\\r\\nwas in America.\" In the same letter he said, \"All those things make me\\r\\nmore enthused about going to church here than in Veldwijk.\" It is not\\r\\ndifficult to understand this reaction. The church was the social center of the\\r\\nDutch-American community. Friends from all over the region gathered\\r\\nthere each Sunday, and after laboring among strangers, the Sunday services\\r\\nprovided a perfect opportunity to forget being in America. The church was\\r\\nalso an especially crucial institution for young men seeking a compatible\\r\\nspouse.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMaatje Riepstra, who became Ulbe\\'s wife, immigrated to Iowa in\\r\\n1893. Although they may have known each other in the Netherlands, their\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"92\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I35.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\ncourtship in Hull, Iowa, was facilitated by meeting each Sunday for worship\\r\\nand instruction. Working long hours six days each week allowed little time\\r\\nfor social activity. Thus, the church, whose explicit goals were religious,\\r\\nbecame the social center of the community. Here young people found mates\\r\\nwhile families visited and discussed the events of the previous week.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBy 1894, just two years after immigrating, Eringa was able to report\\r\\nprogress in achieving the most crucial goals of his life. He had found \"a fine\\r\\nwife,\" and they were living on a 220-acre farm in Running Water, South\\r\\nDakota. He had rented the land on shares which allowed him to keep two\\r\\nthirds of the harvest for his own livelihood. In the process he was acquiring\\r\\nlivestock and equipment which he used later on his own farm. His church\\r\\nhad elected him as an elder, and he was asked to read sermons in the\\r\\nabsence of a regular minister. \"It is good here,\" he declared.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThese concerns &amp;mdash; farm, family, and church &amp;mdash; constituted the abiding\\r\\nsubstance of Ulbe\\'s life. As a farmer he progressed steadily, acquiring his\\r\\nown 160-acre farm in 1899. By 1904 he had accumulated 320 acres and\\r\\nspoke hopefully of paying off the balance of his mortgage. In 1918 he was\\r\\nalready looking forward to retirement and to the prospect of his son\\'s\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"93\"&gt;\\r\\ninheriting the farm. During most of these years Ulbe was not land-poor,\\r\\nbecause he sold cattle and hogs for cash in Chicago. On several occasions\\r\\nhe visited the huge Chicago slaughterhouses and traveled from there to\\r\\nGrand Rapids, Michigan, where he discovered old friends whom he had not\\r\\nseen for twenty-five years. In 1910 he visited the Netherlands with his oldest\\r\\ndaughter to strengthen the familial ties which his frequent correspondence\\r\\nhad preserved. Two of his daughters became teachers, while a third, living\\r\\nnearby, married Johannes v&amp;dot; d&amp;dot; Wei, a farmer and \"a good man.\" Ulbe\\'s only\\r\\nson, Pier, seemed well inclined to life on the farm, and Ulbe expected to\\r\\nleave him a goodly inheritance.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBy participating constantly in the life of his church, Ulbe expanded\\r\\nhis cultural horizons. As a leading elder, he read sermons to the\\r\\ncongregation during the frequent absence of an ordained minister, and on\\r\\ntwo occasions he attended synodical meetings in New York, where he\\r\\n\"heard sermons from the best ministers and missionaries of the Holland\\r\\nReformed Church.\" These occasions, together with his business trips to\\r\\nChicago, exposed Eringa to a large part of America. Eighteen years after his\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I36.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"94\"&gt;\\r\\nimmigration, Ulbe had become a solid citizen of South Dakota and the\\r\\nDutch-American community.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nRunning Water, Eringa\\'s home, was but one of a dozen Dutch\\r\\ncommunities in the southeastern part of South Dakota. Concentrated\\r\\nprimarily in Charles Mix and Douglas Counties, these settlements never\\r\\nprospered as those in Iowa did. Drought forced many immigrants to sell or\\r\\nleave their homesteads and resettle elsewhere. Towns like Nieveen,\\r\\nFriesland, and Running Water were all abandoned. That phenomenon, of\\r\\ncourse, was not peculiar to South Dakota. Even in fertile Iowa more than\\r\\ntwo thousand towns and villages were abandoned during the first hundred\\r\\nyears of the state\\'s existence. Villages without rail connections had little\\r\\nchance of survival, and many towns were organized by promoters who\\r\\nadvertised the virtues of their new sites only to sell land. Frequently\\r\\nrailroads founded towns on their own property and then assured the success\\r\\nof their investments by restricting access to rail transportation within the\\r\\ncompany\\'s town, while causing nearby towns to decline.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWhen the big influx of Dutch settlers entered South Dakota in the\\r\\nearly 1880s, immigrants from several other European countries joined them.\\r\\nEach national group tended to establish its own villages, while Americans,\\r\\nmixing freely among most of the immigrants, usually controlled the\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I37.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"95\"&gt;\\r\\ncounties\\' governmental structure. In Douglas County the Ukrainians,\\r\\nGermans, and Dutch clustered in separate national groups, while in Charles\\r\\nMix County, Dutch villages stood near others with Swedish and Norwegian\\r\\ninhabitants. Ethnic cohesion of this sort was a common feature on the\\r\\nAmerican landscape. Ulbe Eringa noted in 1903 that he had rented a 160-acre\\r\\nfarm from a Norwegian. \"This family,\" he wrote, \"acquired the farm 30\\r\\nyears ago for nothing (under the Homestead Law), and now they can sell it\\r\\nfor $40 per acre. This sixty-year-old couple is moving to a Norwegian city in\\r\\nMinnesota.\" Ulbe concluded, \"That is the way things are here in America.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;From Wisconsin to Nebraska&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe first Dutch immigrants to cultivate the flat Nebraska plains came\\r\\nfrom Wisconsin. J&amp;dot; W&amp;dot; Lefferink, who immigrated to Cedar Grove,\\r\\nWisconsin, in 1868, found little opportunity in that already-crowded village.\\r\\nWithin one year he moved to Lancaster County, Nebraska. Soon others\\r\\nfollowed.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThree Te Selle brothers, who immigrated to Wisconsin in 1865,\\r\\nmoved to Nebraska by 1882. Jon Hendrick Te Selle migrated first, then\\r\\nwrote to his family in Winterswijk, describing Nebraska:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The soil is black clay, no sand, and it has almost no\\r\\nstones... if you crush it between your fingers you find it to be very\\r\\nsoft and without any gravel. The land is thickly covered with grass\\r\\nand has no trees.... We sold our land in Wisconsin for $900. We\\r\\nsold our goods and livestock for $387. We have not had to spend our\\r\\nsavings here, and we live tax free for five years.\"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;note ref=\"2\"&gt;2 &lt;i&gt;Under the Homestead Law of 1862 a settler was only required to pay for the survey and registration\\r\\nof his land, and such homesteads were tax-free for five years. During that time the settler was obliged to\\r\\noccupy and cultivate his land, and thereafter he received a legal title of ownership.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFor a time Jon Hendrick\\'s brother Harm remained in Wisconsin,\\r\\nstruggling to improve his position. In 1867 he was cultivating forty acres,\\r\\nbut had sold another thirty acres of woodland for $750. He calculated that\\r\\nearning 8 percent interest on $750 would bring more income than selling\\r\\nthe lumber. \"Wood is not worth much here because the cost of cutting it is\\r\\ntoo high.\" Writing to his brother Derk in Winterswijk, Harm Jan reported\\r\\nthat land prices were rising rapidly in Wisconsin. Land for which he had\\r\\npaid $25 per acre in 1865 was selling at $50 in 1870. It was also difficult to\\r\\nfind rental property. So Harm suggested that Derk might want to settle in\\r\\nNebraska, where their brother had moved.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNebraska had already become an intriguing option for Harm, and he\\r\\neagerly awaited his brother\\'s detailed report on the area. In any event, he\\r\\nwanted a larger farm. He had tried to purchase two hundred acres from a\\r\\nneighbor who hoped to resettle near his family in Michigan. But the\\r\\nneighbor returned from Michigan reporting that land there was too\\r\\nexpensive and that he had decided to stay in Wisconsin.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"96\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D061\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFinally news from brother Jon arrived, and Harm, reporting its\\r\\ncontents to the family in Winterswijk, said:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Brother J&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; is no longer here; he has moved at least 500\\r\\nmiles further west to the state of Nebraska. There the land is cheap.\\r\\nThere people can buy 100 acres for $80. But they have almost no\\r\\nwood there and at first they have to build a house from sod, or of\\r\\n&amp;lsquo;plaggen&amp;rsquo; as you call it, because lumber costs very much there and it\\r\\nmust be carted over a 13-hour trip. From what I hear it is a total\\r\\nwilderness.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I don\\'t yet know exactly how things are with brother J&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; On\\r\\nthe 28th of March he sold his land and all his goods and then left. He\\r\\nhas not written us a letter but has written to his father-in-law that\\r\\nthey arrived in good health and that the trip cost $100 &amp;mdash; also that the\\r\\nroad passed through terrific mountains and that in some places they\\r\\ncan hardly find water. One man dug a well 100 feet deep and still\\r\\nfound no water. They can get coal there four hours away at $.25 per\\r\\nbushel. They have to use that for fuel because they have no wood.\\r\\nMore people have gone there, but I know of two who have already\\r\\nreturned as they did not like it. I know little more about it, although\\r\\nsome people write that there are many rattle snakes and prairie wolves\\r\\nout there.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D062\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAside from inexpensive land, there was little in that report to attract\\r\\na prospective immigrant. But acquiring land was the main objective, and for\\r\\nHarm, Wisconsin was no longer a land of opportunity &amp;mdash; especially after he\\r\\nfaced a severe pest problem in 1870:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;As for the potatoes and what they will produce, I don\\'t know\\r\\nwhat to expect. Last year we were plagued enormously with worms;\\r\\nthey ate everything green. Now it is even worse &amp;mdash; it seems that as\\r\\nsoon as the potatoes can be seen growing, the worms come out of the\\r\\nground and sit waiting with their mouths open.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis problem, though clearly aggravating, was not the main cause of\\r\\nHarm\\'s migration to Nebraska. Rather, it was the high price of land which\\r\\ncontinued to restrict his ambition. In 1870 he wrote that several recent\\r\\nDutch immigrants, expecting to purchase farms in Wisconsin, had been\\r\\nforced to become day laborers. Although their wage, $1.50 per day, was\\r\\nmuch higher than they could have expected in the Netherlands, these\\r\\npeople were deeply disappointed. Together with Harm, they drifted\\r\\nwestward.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHarm joined his brother on Nebraska\\'s windy flatlands. During his\\r\\nfirst year there he witnessed one of the prairie\\'s most dreaded hazards.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;On Sunday, October 15, we went to church in the morning\\r\\nand the wind was already blowing terrifically.... Then, when we&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"97\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;came out of church, we saw smoke in the distance because the prairie\\r\\nwas on fire. The prairie is all grass here... and when it is dry, it\\r\\nburns tremendously... and it can burn for miles. Thus, as I said,\\r\\nas we came out of church we saw the fire. One man &amp;mdash; his name is\\r\\nNicholas Vander Velde &amp;mdash; saw that it was not far from his house. He\\r\\nwas in church with his wife and two children, but had three children\\r\\nat home.... He ran as fast as he could to go home, but then he\\r\\nsaw that his house was nothing but ashes &amp;mdash; his hay, grain, barn, and\\r\\npigs all burned. But that was not the worst. In the distance he saw\\r\\nsomething white lying on the ground, and he thought it was a calf, but\\r\\nas he came closer, he saw that it was his oldest daughter burned to\\r\\ndeath. After further search he found the two other children burned to\\r\\ndeath in the ruins of the house. There was also much other\\r\\ndestruction from the fire.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D063\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDespite such hazards, the Te Selle brothers remained in Nebraska,\\r\\nenduring successive disasters from grasshoppers and drought between 1873\\r\\nand 1875. By 1876 conditions improved, and the community grew. G&amp;dot; J&amp;dot;,\\r\\nanother of the brothers, arrived in 1882. By that time the area had the\\r\\nregular services of a Dutch church. Its members tended to cluster near each\\r\\nother for mutual assistance and social compatibility. Describing a segment of\\r\\nFirth, Nebraska, in 1882, Harm wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;W&amp;dot; Leverdink is my next-door neighbor, Obbink van de Hoort\\r\\nlives [near] us, and brother Jon Hendrick a half mile away. Kolte has\\r\\nnow bought 80 acres of my land, and he will rent or sell his other\\r\\nplace because he wants to live among the Hollanders. We are three\\r\\nmiles from the church, but everyone drives here, and people do not\\r\\nhave to ask if they may ride along. Everyone just steps into the wagon&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I38.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"98\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;as long as there is room. Here there is no difference between the poor\\r\\nand the rich.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAfter the difficulties of the 1870s were behind them, the Te Selle\\r\\nbrothers prospered. They expanded their farms and acquired additional land\\r\\nfor their numerous children. By 1895 J&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; Te Selle had purchased 480\\r\\nacres &amp;mdash; more than he could cultivate. His daughters found husbands among\\r\\nneighboring Dutch farmers, and his brothers also prospered. Among them,\\r\\nthe Te Selle brothers had at least twenty-five children. Their community in\\r\\nFirth grew steadily, and by 1948 the local Dutch church numbered three\\r\\nhundred families. In general, however, Nebraska never attracted large\\r\\nnumbers of Dutch-Americans.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D064\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Come to Kansas&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nKansas, another of the Great Plains states, also attracted a small group\\r\\nof Dutch immigrants, but the pattern of settlement closely resembled that of\\r\\nSouth Dakota and Nebraska. Roelof Mulder moved from Firth to Luctor,\\r\\nKansas, in 1891. Describing their new home, Mulder\\'s wife, Anje Nieveen,\\r\\nwrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Dear Uncle, I received your letter in the beginning of March &amp;mdash;\\r\\nnot in Nebraska, but in Kansas. We left Nebraska on the third of\\r\\nMarch. As you probably know, we did not have our own land there.\\r\\nThe 160 acres we tilled there was owned by Jim, Roelof, and their\\r\\nfather together. Now that father Mulder has died, the land was sold,\\r\\nand now Roelof has bought 160 acres here. You are probably\\r\\nthinking, my but you move often &amp;mdash; yes, that is the American spirit.\\r\\nThe land in Nebraska was already expensive. We sold it &amp;mdash; 160 acres,&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I39.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"99\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;two houses and some stables &amp;mdash; for $4,000. And now Roelof has\\r\\npurchased this land for $1,500 &amp;mdash; without a house, but it has a stable.\\r\\nThe creek runs across the land at an angle so that on one side we\\r\\nhave 90 acres and 70 acres on the other side. It is a running creek so\\r\\nthat we have more than enough water for our livestock. Also, there\\r\\nare trees on both sides of the creek which we can use for fuel.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;There is less expensive land available here as well as more\\r\\nexpensive, depending on whether it has buildings on it and upon the\\r\\nlocation. Because we didn\\'t have enough time to build a house this\\r\\nspring, we have rented a farm nearby which Roelof and his brother\\r\\nwork together, and this winter we will build our own house. It looks\\r\\ngood to me here &amp;mdash; as good as Nebraska. But it is still not densely\\r\\npopulated. We live five miles from the Holland Church where\\r\\nDominie Scholten is the minister. He is a young minister, but still\\r\\nvery serious and with a soft voice. They have a nice church here and\\r\\nthe minister gets a $700 salary. We are also five miles from the\\r\\nrailroad station, where we bring our crops and can buy lumber. The\\r\\nland here is a little more hilly than in Dakota, but there the soil has\\r\\nmore stones and rocks. We have found none here.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Things go well here for us in all earthly matters. We have a\\r\\ngood living and so does the rest of the family. Still we must work\\r\\nhard.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAnje Nieveen\\'s description of Luctor, Kansas, could easily be used to\\r\\nsketch the circumstances she shared with several hundred other Dutch\\r\\nimmigrants in Kansas and Nebraska. Large colonies did not develop in these\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I40.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"100\"&gt;\\r\\nstates. Instead, a few isolated Dutch communities have continued to survive\\r\\namid seemingly endless fields of wheat. With proper rainfall, Kansas and\\r\\nNebraska have yielded enormous harvests. Kansas alone produces one-fifth\\r\\nof the nation\\'s wheat crop.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D065\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Disaster in Colorado&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe arid southwest &amp;mdash; Texas, Colorado, and their neighboring states &amp;mdash;\\r\\nalso attracted the Dutch immigrants\\' attention, although no extensive\\r\\nDutch colony developed in these regions. Several colonization efforts in\\r\\nTexas failed, and in Colorado one widely publicized venture ended in total\\r\\ndisarray.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nC&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; Sluys, who immigrated from Enkhuizen in 1892, joined this\\r\\nColorado venture after reading a pamphlet circulated by the \"Nederlandsch-Americaansche\\r\\nLand en Emigratie Maatschappij.\" This organization, which\\r\\noriginated in the Netherlands, extolled the virtues of land in the San Luis\\r\\nValley, describing it as the \"Italy of western North America.\" In that\\r\\nregion, the promoters promised, a farm of eighty acres could produce\\r\\nenough to pay all the farmer\\'s obligations and provide a profit of 6-7,000\\r\\nguilders annually. After reading the pamphlet, C&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; Sluys and his wife\\r\\nagreed that they would like to join the emigrant society, but not without\\r\\ntheir father\\'s consent. They asked him to read the pamphlet, with the prior\\r\\nunderstanding that they would use his reaction as a sign. If he counseled\\r\\nagainst emigration, they would remain in the Netherlands. After reading\\r\\nthe advertisement, the old man said, \"Even if this is only half true, I still\\r\\nbelieve that it would be better to join that venture than to remain here.\"\\r\\nThe credibility of the Colorado venture was further enhanced by the\\r\\nsupport it received from a respected theology professor, M&amp;dot; Noordzij, from\\r\\nKampen. Thus the die was cast, and the C&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; Sluys family joined a group\\r\\nof 211 emigrants sailing toward Colorado.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nUpon their arrival the settlers were housed in two barracks, each\\r\\ncontaining a hundred people. C&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; Sluys reported that the high altitude,\\r\\n8,000 feet above sea level, was too radical a change for people who had\\r\\nbeen raised in the lowlands, and that at night the winter temperatures\\r\\ndropped far below zero. Then, in these compressed living conditions, scarlet\\r\\nfever broke out among the children, causing eleven of them to die. \"Our\\r\\nyoungest darling,\" Sluys wrote, \"a girl of eight months, was the last of\\r\\nthese.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe pamphlet which attracted these folk to Colorado proved to be a\\r\\ncomplete fabrication. Its author had never visited the site. If he had, he\\r\\nwould have recognized that the area\\'s dry soil was totally useless. The\\r\\ndisappointed immigrants telegraphed Professor Noordzij and he responded,\\r\\n\"I\\'m coming immediately.\" Before he arrived, the colony split up, but a\\r\\nnumber remained together, awaiting the professor\\'s assistance. When he\\r\\nappeared, it was agreed that they should find better land at a lower altitude.\\r\\nSome, then settled on government land near the Nebraska border.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"101\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMeanwhile, C&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; Sluys felt obliged to report their troublesome\\r\\nexperiences to the newspaper in Enkhuizen. When news of this sabotage\\r\\nreached the immigration society\\'s agent in Colorado, Sluys was thrown out\\r\\nof the colony. Hearing this, Sluys\\'s wife, whom he described as \"not easily\\r\\ndiscouraged,\" broke down. \"Now what must we do,\" she wailed, \"8000 miles\\r\\nfrom our family, in a land where we can hardly speak the language and\\r\\nthrown out of the colony with neither money nor food in sight, and then\\r\\nwithout a house in two days?\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSluys sought advice from an English neighbor for whom his fourteen-year-old\\r\\ndaughter had been working. Following his neighbor\\'s advice, Sluys\\r\\nfound work with a railroad construction crew sixteen miles away. Soon\\r\\nthereafter part of the colony disbanded. Most of them received assistance\\r\\nfrom Dutch churches in Iowa and relocated in the older colonies. A few,\\r\\nlike Sluys, drifted from one place to another.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWorking by turns on railroad construction and as a farmer, Sluys\\r\\nremained in Colorado for about ten years. His farming efforts were hindered\\r\\nby conflicts over water rights (irrigation was necessary in Colorado) and by\\r\\ndistant markets. Without railroad connections his crops had to be sold\\r\\nlocally, and the sparse Colorado population produced slight demand. On\\r\\none occasion prices were so low that the local farmers burned their grain for\\r\\nfuel.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFor a time Sluys worked as a gardener in Sterling, Colorado, while his\\r\\nwife operated a restaurant in their home. Finally, exasperated by the dry and\\r\\ncapricious climate, Sluys decided \"to move northward or toward the Pacific\\r\\nCoast.\" For one year he labored in Nebraska, saving money to finance his\\r\\none-thousand-mile trek to Montana. After reaching Great Falls, Montana,\\r\\nhe ran out of money and again found employment with a railroad\\r\\nconstruction gang. He became a shift boss and was forced to move westward\\r\\nwith the progress of the railroad\\'s construction, but he gained free housing\\r\\nat each new location.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThen, in 1908, he returned to farming on government land near\\r\\nConrad, Montana, where he acquired 560 acres: Unable to locate water for\\r\\nirrigation, he sold part of this land and moved to another location in the\\r\\nConrad area. There he was quite successful.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBy 1923 part of his family had migrated to Lynden, Washington, and\\r\\nSluys followed his children to that successful Dutch Colony. There, where\\r\\nthe Pacific Ocean restricted the westward movement, Sluys returned to\\r\\ngardening and cultivated several acres to provide for himself. \"Lynden,\" he\\r\\nwrote, \"is a good place; there is much land here close to the river which is\\r\\nas fertile as the best land in Holland for agriculture.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nTo choose such a lonely trek was exceptional among the Calvinist\\r\\nDutch immigrants. On one occasion Sluys wrote that he had not seen\\r\\nanother Dutchman in seven years. He did, however, communicate regularly\\r\\nwith his family in Enkhuizen, and he was happy to discover Dutch churches\\r\\nin Conrad, Montana, and Lynden, Washington.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"102\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nLynden and its neighboring Dutch settlements were among the last to\\r\\nbe founded by Dutch-Americans. Like Orange City, Firth, and Running\\r\\nWater, they were established to satisfy a constant demand for inexpensive\\r\\nland. The founding of the Washington settlements occurred in the late\\r\\n1890s, during the last days of the general American frontier. Thus, while\\r\\nopen land existed, the Dutch joined other Americans in their pursuit of\\r\\nagricultural opportunities. The most successful Dutch colonies on the West\\r\\nCoast were established by immigrants with previous experience in older\\r\\ncolonies where land had become scarce or expensive.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;The Pacific Coast&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nOak Harbor, Washington, was the Dutch-Americans\\' first colony on\\r\\nthe Pacific Coast. Reports of that area\\'s fertility reached the older Dutch\\r\\nsettlements after 1894, and soon settlers were arriving from western\\r\\nMichigan, Chicago, and South Dakota. They acquired farms of forty or\\r\\neighty acres, still encumbered with stumps left by lumber companies. After\\r\\nclearing the land, the settlers immediately established a church. By 1898\\r\\nfour additional Dutch colonies were located in the far northwest corner of\\r\\nWashington. Among these Lynden became the most prosperous.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn many respects conditions in the Washington colonies resembled\\r\\nthose of western Michigan in the 1850s. Opportunities for employment were\\r\\nvaried: poor immigrants could begin as laborers in the sawmills and\\r\\nfisheries. Those bent on agriculture could acquire stump land while working\\r\\nas day laborers. Others, who preferred business and trade, found markets\\r\\nand harbor facilities in the cities along the Pacific Coast.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nOene Heller, who immigrated from Ulrum in 1891, settled first near\\r\\nHolland, Michigan; but in 1896, after minimal progress there, he moved to\\r\\nOak Harbor, Washington. Heller had struggled with a ten-acre farm in\\r\\nMichigan, supplementing that narrow living as a day laborer. In Oak\\r\\nHarbor he reported earning twice as much as he had in Michigan. He\\r\\nacquired land and expected to build a new house there. Meanwhile, he\\r\\nrented a house in the village of Oak Harbor. The fishing fleets that docked\\r\\nnearby often provided him and his neighbors with free fish. Heller\\'s wife\\r\\nreported that they had acquired \"a whole sack full for each of the five\\r\\nGroninger families living in their neighborhood.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1897 Heller wrote, \"Many Hollanders have followed us here.\" He\\r\\nwas making high wages and expected to begin cultivating his land that\\r\\nspring. Comparing Washington with Michigan, he wrote, \"People don\\'t\\r\\nhave to work in the cold and snow. I would not go back to Michigan for\\r\\n$1,000. That is the truth. We are all happy that we made the trip.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHeller\\'s zeal differed little from the enthusiasm expressed by those of\\r\\nhis predecessors who discovered pleasant circumstances in Michigan, South\\r\\nDakota, and elsewhere. But the West Coast did offer an extraordinarily\\r\\nattractive climate. Lacking Michigan\\'s harsh winters and the hot dry winds\\r\\nof the prairie states, Washington and California offered a more ideal\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"103\"&gt;\\r\\nclimate, together with astonishingly fertile valleys. The economic potential\\r\\nin California was especially obvious, but despite several organized efforts to\\r\\nlure Dutch settlers there, no successful colony grew in California until after\\r\\nthe turn of the century.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBy 1910 a small community of Dutch-Americans had settled in\\r\\nRedlands, California, where they organized a Dutch church. After several\\r\\npoor crops, many of these people resettled in Los Angeles, where they\\r\\norganized another church. Dutch communities in California began to thrive\\r\\nafter 1917, when a group from South Dakota organized a community in\\r\\nRipon and a number of Frisians settled in Bellflower. The latter quickly\\r\\nbecame a dairy center, and farmers with huge herds hired young people from\\r\\nthe Dutch communities of the Midwest as helpers. Many of these remained\\r\\nin California to establish their own dairy herds, where, as one immigrant\\r\\nwrote, \"they do nothing but milk the cows and sell the cream, and the only\\r\\ncrop they raise in alfalfa.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAfter World War II a large contingent of Dutch immigrants settled in\\r\\nCalifornia. An even greater number moved to Canada.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D066\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Canada, Too&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe first Dutch-Canadian immigrants preceded the World War II\\r\\ninflux. A number of Dutch-Americans resettled in the western provinces of\\r\\nCanada during the 1890s, taking advantage of lenient homestead laws.\\r\\nAnother group of families immigrated to Manitoba in 1892; by 1913 a Dutch\\r\\ncommunity numbering approximately 1,000 people had grown in Winnipeg.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nStill other settlers &amp;mdash; W&amp;dot;M&amp;dot; Bos, for example, an immigrant from\\r\\nDrenthe &amp;mdash; were drawn to several parts of Saskatchewan. Like so many of his\\r\\npredecessors, Bos began his immigrant life as a farmhand. However, he was\\r\\nno pauper. He worked for a large Canadian farmer to gain experience and\\r\\nadditional time for selecting a favorable location. Indicating the priorities\\r\\nthat governed his land choice, Bos wrote in 1911:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Last week I went to Swift Current... and looked at some\\r\\nland. But I have not yet found anything that looks good to me.\\r\\nPerhaps I shall also look in Montana where many farms are available.\\r\\nThey already have a Dutch settlement there, and they also have a\\r\\nchurch. I believe I will find more satisfaction there, although I will\\r\\nprobably make less money in Montana. But I often tell myself, you\\r\\nonly have one life to live and there is no reason why you shouldn\\'t\\r\\nbenefit from the privileges already available in Montana.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe following year Bos reported that he had chosen to remain in\\r\\nCanada, a choice influenced by the organization of a \"Gereformeerde\"\\r\\nchurch in the settlement of Cramersburg.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Our church is not very large, but it has a good chance to\\r\\npersevere. At present ministers serve us at least four times each year&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"104\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I41.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"portrait\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"105\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;and they remain with us several weeks each time. At the same time\\r\\nthey administer the sacraments. Otherwise we have two sermon\\r\\nreadings each Sunday which the elders deliver.... It gives us much\\r\\npleasure to join the family of faith at God\\'s altar. We have already\\r\\nbegun to collect money to build a church and pay our expenses.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAfter his third year in Canada, Bos planned to publicize advice to\\r\\nprospective immigrants in Groningen and Drenthe. He was particularly\\r\\nconcerned about immigrants who, in searching for land, would find\\r\\nthemselves widely separated from the Reformed church community and its\\r\\nspiritual benefits:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Perhaps I will write a piece for a few Holland newspapers this\\r\\nwinter. My main purpose will be to warn our &amp;lsquo;Gereformeerde&amp;rsquo; people\\r\\nparticularly not to forsake the fellowship of the church. Of course, it\\r\\nis true that the Lord will establish his church over the whole world,\\r\\nbut there are many people who follow the example of Lot, who chose\\r\\nthe plain of Jordan where the surrounding godlessness tormented his\\r\\nsoul. Also, many people immigrate like blind men. It is especially\\r\\ndifficult for families to find a good place immediately. But now, helped\\r\\nby our church\\'s home mission activity, many new churches have been\\r\\nestablished in Canada. These have made it possible for newcomers to\\r\\nestablish themselves within the circle of the church.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1912 Bos married. Reporting about that event, he wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;This year has brought me the purest desire of my life on earth &amp;mdash;\\r\\nthat is, a loving wife. Being married is fine, much better than tending\\r\\nyour own pot of food like a hermit.... Together we have a full and\\r\\nsatisfying life. We eat well and help each other as much as possible to\\r\\nmake life pleasant. We have begun our household with the intention\\r\\nof taking the high road. It is our common practice to pray both before\\r\\nand after mealtimes. I close the meal with audible prayer and my wife\\r\\nreads a chapter from God\\'s Word.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt would be easy to denigrate Bos\\'s piety as either excessively atypical,\\r\\nor the temporary enthusiasm of a newlywed. To contend that the sheen of\\r\\nhis polished intentions probably tarnished with time is merely common\\r\\nsense. But however atypical, temporary, or ultimately tarnished, Bos\\'s values\\r\\nare precisely those which have preserved ethnic identity in Dutch-America.\\r\\nReaching from New Jersey to California, Dutch settlements of every size\\r\\nhave been bound together by their chosen denominations. Pious families\\r\\nsought instruction and inspiration in their local churches, which became\\r\\nthe religious-cultural eye through which the immigrants viewed American\\r\\nsociety.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"106\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I42.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"107\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D067\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div2 name=\"Chapter 6 Dutch Churches in America\" type=\"chapter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;he retention of ethnic identity among Dutch-Americans leans\\r\\nheavily on the preservation of their churches. The\\r\\ninterrelationship of these two factors can hardly be\\r\\noveremphasized: in fact, no Dutch community in America has\\r\\nsurvived without its Dutch churches. Throughout the period of\\r\\nimmigration, those communities that were unable to support a church\\r\\ndisintegrated rapidly.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBut the Dutch church in America was no monolith. From the outset\\r\\nit was a fragmented body; its members disagreed about theology, church\\r\\npolity, and the elements of worship. Some of these distinctions had origins\\r\\nin the various Dutch provinces from which the immigrants came, but the\\r\\nmost powerful divisions grew within the American setting. The potential for\\r\\ndenominational unity fractured on the rock of Americanization.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDutch-Americans drew the issues of their debates from their\\r\\necclesiastical experience in the Netherlands, trying, as much as possible, to\\r\\nmaintain those practices that they carried with them to the New World.\\r\\nEach church group defended its views by appealing to confessional\\r\\nstatements and practices originating in the Netherlands; innovations were\\r\\nsuspect. Thus, whenever the customs of American church life made inroads\\r\\ninto the immigrant churches, new conflicts developed.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nTo preserve and perpetuate their views, the immigrants established\\r\\nschools and seminaries that drew upon the intellectual traditions and\\r\\nresources of the Netherlands. Immigrant children who sought professional\\r\\ncareers frequently attended the schools their parents had founded. There\\r\\nthey acquired respect for an intellectual tradition and piety born in the\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"108\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I43.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\nNetherlands. Many of these students &amp;mdash; especially ministers and teachers &amp;mdash;\\r\\npracticed their professions within the immigrant communities scattered\\r\\nacross the North American continent. Thus, through successive\\r\\ngenerations, the Dutch-American community has trained its own leaders,\\r\\nwho, in turn, have preserved an essential core of the Dutch-American\\r\\ntradition.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;A Pious Folk&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nPiety, the most obvious foundation of that tradition, was not peculiar\\r\\nto any fragment of Dutch-Americans. Virtually all the immigrants, Catholic\\r\\nand Protestant &amp;mdash; from farms, shops, cities and towns &amp;mdash; accounted for their\\r\\ndaily circumstances with references to God\\'s pleasure and judgment. This\\r\\nattitude probably grew stronger among those who faced the uncertainties of\\r\\nimmigration, but prior to the extreme secularization of the twentieth\\r\\ncentury, Christians everywhere spoke more readily of God\\'s hand in nature\\r\\nor in daily affairs.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D068\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWith the passing of each old year, the immigrants frequently wrote\\r\\nreflections on the year\\'s events. E&amp;dot; Wonnink\\'s letter of 1872 provides an\\r\\nespecially clear example of this custom:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"109\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We can report that we are all in good health, and it is our\\r\\nfondest wish to hear the same of you. The old year has quickly passed\\r\\nby with all of its good fortune and adversity &amp;mdash; with its joys and griefs.\\r\\nBut, on the other hand, we have seen much evidence of God\\'s mercy.\\r\\nWhen we confess our sins, he draws us to himself, either with love\\r\\nand blessing or with fatherly chastisements &amp;mdash; all this to make us more\\r\\ndependent on him. So we stand ready to enter the new year, not\\r\\nknowing what it will bring. But if we place all our trust in Him, we\\r\\nneed not fear the future, whether it bring prosperity or adversity.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlthough more elaborately expressed with the changing of the year,\\r\\nsuch expressions of dependence on God appeared regularly in the\\r\\nimmigrants\\' correspondence. For them closeness to God was a way of life.\\r\\nFear of ill health and death constantly pursued the people of the last\\r\\ncentury; few immigrant letters can be found without greetings\\r\\nacknowledging, \"through God\\'s goodness, I remain in good health.\" The\\r\\nwords of C&amp;dot; Snoeyenbosch demonstrate a common pattern of \"taking leave\":\\r\\n\"Now we will close for this time and wish you the blessings of the Almighty\\r\\non both your body and soul &amp;mdash; for time and for eternity.\" When sickness\\r\\noccurred, the usual response followed the example of H&amp;dot; Tijnes, who wrote\\r\\nin 1900, \"Father was seriously ill, but the Lord, who holds our life in his\\r\\nhands, and who directs all our paths, has spared him.\" Death, \"exchanging\\r\\ntime with eternity,\" required more lengthy reports, but they commonly\\r\\nconcluded with the firm conviction that all would be well because \"the Lord\\r\\nreigns.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe immigrants applied this matter-of-fact dependence on God\\'s\\r\\nprovidence to virtually every facet of their lives. In 1850 G&amp;dot; Heerspink\\r\\nwrote, \"I also wish to tell you that under the wise and all-ruling providence\\r\\nof God, I have married Fenna Bouwkamp on the tenth of this month. She\\r\\ncomes from Voorwald in Graafschap Bentheim, and, God be thanked, we\\r\\nenjoy good health.\" E&amp;dot; Wonnink, after surviving shipwreck in 1871, wrote,\\r\\n\"God allowed the water to come upon us, but not over our lips.\" Writing\\r\\nfrom Orange City, Iowa, in 1882, H&amp;dot; Berghuis declared, \"It is so here that\\r\\npeople can prosper better than in the Netherlands &amp;mdash; if they will work and if\\r\\nthey enjoy the blessings of the Lord.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nGod\\'s hand also appeared in adversity, and although hard to bear, such\\r\\ndifficulties brought strengthened faith. Poor harvests or destructive storms\\r\\nwere understood as tests of faith or, perhaps, the consequence of sin. Pious\\r\\nfolk often agreed that a severe national crisis demonstrated God\\'s\\r\\nchastisement. During the bloody American Civil War Peter Baden wrote,\\r\\n\"The country is in a miserable situation; God is bringing judgment on its\\r\\nsons because they have neglected His laws.\" H&amp;dot; Gruppen understood the\\r\\neconomic depression of the 1930s as another of God\\'s chastisements and\\r\\nsaid, \"If the people show more respect for God, perhaps he will take the\\r\\nproblem away.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"110\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D069\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Flee The Future Wrath&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe earliest immigrants, those arriving before the 1870s, expressed\\r\\ntheir piety more openly than the second wave of newcomers. Some of the\\r\\nfirst immigrants believed that they had narrowly escaped God\\'s impending\\r\\njudgment on the Netherlands, and they urged their friends and relatives to\\r\\nflee the imminent visitation of God\\'s wrath. Rev&amp;dot; Adrian Zwemer, while\\r\\nexpressing affection for his native land, still felt constrained to advise Rev&amp;dot;\\r\\nHelenius de Cock in 1857, \"It is easy for me to pass judgment on you, but\\r\\nonly God knows men\\'s hearts. Still allow me to urge you &amp;mdash; flee the coming\\r\\nwrath.\" In 1850 G&amp;dot; Heerspink urged even more emphatically:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Now we would like to warn you while there is still time. Make\\r\\nhaste, make haste to flee God\\'s judgment on the Netherlands. For\\r\\nyou must believe it &amp;mdash; a dark cloud of judgment hangs over the\\r\\nNetherlands. Think about the situation there and you will discover, if\\r\\nit pleases God to enlighten your spirit, that the prophecy of Revelation\\r\\n18 is about to be fulfilled. Therefore, flee the certain wrath of God.\\r\\nCome here. Live in peace, and enjoy the good fruits of this land.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D070\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn less judgmental tones other immigrants proclaimed that God had\\r\\npreserved parts of North America as a special refuge for the Netherlanders\\r\\nwho fled the over-populated fatherland. In 1850 J&amp;dot; Dunnink wrote, \"It seems\\r\\nthat the Lord has preserved this place (western Michigan) especially for the\\r\\nNetherlanders.\" Writing from Grand Haven in 1854, Markus Nienhuis said:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I tell you that I never had better prospects for success than I\\r\\nhave here, and I am convinced that God did not create the world to\\r\\nbe so thickly populated that people must nearly eat each other out of\\r\\nhunger and let each other lie desolate. When I was in the\\r\\nNetherlands, I often heard it said that nothing could be done because\\r\\nthere were too many people in the world. But that is a mistaken\\r\\nimpression. I believe the rulers spread these ideas to discourage\\r\\nemigration. But it is not true. There is land enough on which\\r\\nmankind can live in abundance. Let them leave the Netherlands and\\r\\ncome here.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Zeelanders\\' Piety&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMost of the immigrants acknowledged God\\'s imprint on their lives,\\r\\nbut for others, particularly Zeelanders, piety turned inward. Their letters\\r\\nexhibit constant self-examination, demonstrating an extraordinary concern\\r\\nfor their spiritual condition. Often a large part of their correspondence\\r\\nconsisted of pious exhortations. For these, Christianity was more a matter of\\r\\ninner feelings than an acquiescence to God\\'s will. P&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Oggel, one of Van\\r\\nRaalte\\'s students from Axel, wrote of Rev&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Budding: \"He says what is\\r\\ngoing on in his own heart, and so far as I know, he is very trustworthy.\"\\r\\nBudding, a restless itinerant, was well-known for his independent\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"111\"&gt;\\r\\nspiritualism. Other immigrants from Zeeland were similarly inclined.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D071\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nPeter Lankester from Vere immigrated to the Milwaukee area in 1850\\r\\nand corresponded with his brother until 1867. In these letters Lankester not\\r\\nonly described his own spiritual condition but also frequently urged his\\r\\nfamily to examine their souls. For example, in 1855 he wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We hope that you and your family are being molded by the\\r\\nLord, but above all, that he has poured out his grace on you, because\\r\\nwe stand at death\\'s door every hour &amp;mdash; and what can we expect if we\\r\\nare not one with Christ....

Christians who emphasize their inner spiritual state and\\r\\nurge humankind to radical conversions frequently grow impatient with\\r\\ndoctrinal or denominational distinctions: in America, the major revivalists\\r\\nlike Billy Sunday and Billy Graham have usually been nondenominational,\\r\\noften proclaiming, \"No creed but Christ.\" Similarly pietistic Netherlanders\\r\\ncould easily identify with their American counterparts. P&amp;dot; Lankester, who\\r\\nattended a revival in 1865, reported:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;A few weeks ago a minister, sponsored by the [RCA] synod,\\r\\narrived here. He has been sent throughout America to be God\\'s agent\\r\\nin bringing the people to conversion and to awaken God\\'s people so\\r\\nthat the church may be enlarged and reveal godly lives. There are an\\r\\nexceptionally large number of churches here, and each has its own\\r\\nminister, but all of them have joined together in order to assist the\\r\\nguest minister, Mr&amp;dot; Potter. He has been here now for about 14 days\\r\\nand he preaches three times each day, while local ministers usually\\r\\noffer the prayers.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I have never before heard a man with such gifts. In the morning\\r\\nand at noon he preaches in the largest church, which holds 3,000,\\r\\nand at 7:30 in the evening he preaches in a rented auditorium which\\r\\neasily seats 6,000. I have never seen such a large gathering in one\\r\\nplace. Before each service they have a prayer hour and Mr&amp;dot; Potter&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"112\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;invites anyone who wishes to say something about their family or\\r\\nacquaintances to openly declare their desire for prayer. I have seen\\r\\nand heard many different men, women, and children take their turns\\r\\nby standing to declare their needs. I have attended the meeting with\\r\\nour minister several times and it was a moving experience. Some\\r\\npeople with unconverted husbands and children in the army or on the\\r\\nbattlefields sought prayers. Sometimes the tears flooded my eyes. This\\r\\nminister, Potter, will take no money whatsoever, nor will he allow a\\r\\ncollection. This is almost never done in American churches.

There are\\r\\nsmall places here with three churches and parsonages trying to call\\r\\nthree different ministers, when in fact one church, parsonage, and\\r\\nminister would be sufficient &amp;mdash; and then the two extra ministers could\\r\\nbe sent to other places in order to fulfill the command, \"Go out and\\r\\npreach the Gospel.\"&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I44.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"113\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D075\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;A Period of Confusion&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nA few immigrants, like R&amp;dot; Lohuis in Glen Roy, Iowa, complained that\\r\\nevery Dutch-American wanted his own private church. \"When we,\" he\\r\\nwrote in 1869, \"go to church, we go to the English church. We like that\\r\\nbest. We belong to the English Congregational or Presbyterian Church.\\r\\nThat is most like the big Reformed Church in Holland.\" To join an\\r\\n\"English\" church was rather uncommon among Dutch immigrants, but\\r\\nchoosing a church because of its similarity to a familiar church in the\\r\\nNetherlands was a very common immigrant pattern. Almost without\\r\\nexception the immigrants sought and joined those churches that seemed\\r\\nmost like the churches they had left behind. And when no satisfactory\\r\\ninstitution seemed available, they organized new churches and\\r\\ndenominations.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDuring the first decades of immigrant experience, Dutch-Americans\\r\\njoined or organized a variety of denominations. Van Raalte led most of the\\r\\nwest Michigan colony into a union with the Reformed Protestant Dutch\\r\\nChurch which had originated in New Amsterdam during the seventeenth\\r\\ncentury. But two congregations in the Michigan colony had difficulties with\\r\\nVan Raalte\\'s leadership and joined the Presbyterian denomination. In 1857\\r\\nanother segment rejected Van Raalte\\'s decision to affiliate with the\\r\\nReformed Protestant Dutch Church and organized a new denomination, the\\r\\nWare Hollandsch Gereformeerde Kerk.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSimilar divisions developed in Wisconsin. Rev&amp;dot; Pieter Zoone\\r\\ninfluenced several congregations to affiliate with the Presbyterian\\r\\ndenomination. Other churches followed Van Raalte\\'s example, while still\\r\\nothers joined the newly formed Ware Hollandsch Gereformeerde Kerk. In\\r\\nOostburg, Wisconsin, one small congregation followed the advice of a lay\\r\\nminister, K&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Van Aagtekerk, and remained completely independent.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn Iowa, H&amp;dot; P&amp;dot; Scholte also remained independent, but his followers\\r\\nwere dissatisfied with that arrangement and scattered in many directions.\\r\\nWriting from Pella in 1862, John Witzenburg declared:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Now friends, I will close, for if I begin to talk about church\\r\\nlife, I won\\'t know where to stop. One claims to follow Scholte and\\r\\nanother claims to be Reformed. Still others call themselves Baptists,\\r\\nMethodists, and even something called dead-sleepers. And all this\\r\\namong intelligent people with much knowledge so that I often marvel\\r\\nhow things could have come to such errors.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nCharacterizing the situation in 1859, Maria Brandt wrote from the\\r\\nsmall Wisconsin village of Town 8, \"There is still much division among the\\r\\nHollanders in America, most of it pertaining to religion.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;A Tale of Two Denominations&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis confusing situation continued into the 1870s, but thereafter two\\r\\ndenominations attracted the loyalties of most immigrants. Van Raalte\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"114\"&gt;\\r\\nspearheaded a movement to form an ecclesiastical bond with the Reformed\\r\\nProtestant Dutch Church, known today as the Reformed Church in\\r\\nAmerica. Most of the early immigrants followed Van Raalte\\'s leadership and\\r\\njoined this church group. Originating in the seventeenth century, this\\r\\ndenomination was quite Americanized. They had adopted the English\\r\\nlanguage in worship and supported some of the revival techniques prevalent\\r\\namong the evangelical churches of America. Further, since revivals were\\r\\nessentially interdenominational efforts, the Reformed Church in America\\r\\nassociated more readily with other church groups and developed a somewhat\\r\\necumenical posture. These developments provided a comfortable situation\\r\\nfor not only the more pietistic early immigrants but also later immigrants,\\r\\nwho preferred a more rapid pace of Americanization.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nImmigrants adhering more tenaciously to the ecclesiastical patterns of\\r\\nthe Netherlands tended to join the &lt;i&gt;Ware Hollandsch Gereformeerde Kerk,&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\nknown today as the Christian Reformed Church. This denomination\\r\\ncontinued using the Dutch language in worship well into the 1930s. It has\\r\\nmaintained official connections with the &lt;i&gt;Gereformeerde Kerken&lt;/i&gt; in the\\r\\nNetherlands from 1882 to the present, and it has opposed adopting the\\r\\nrevival techniques which the immigrants frequently identified with\\r\\nMethodism.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMany of the immigrants who were part of the second great stream of\\r\\nimmigration from the Netherlands, 1880-1920, joined the Christian\\r\\nReformed Church. The familiar language, pattern of worship, and\\r\\nconnection with the &lt;i&gt;Gereformeerde Kerk&lt;/i&gt; in the Netherlands combined to\\r\\nmake this choice attractive. Moreover, the already-established immigrants of\\r\\nthe earlier period dominated the western segment of the Reformed Church\\r\\nin America. So immigrants of the late-nineteenth century were able to\\r\\ninfluence the character of the Christian Reformed Church more readily\\r\\nthan they could influence the larger and well-established Reformed Church.\\r\\nAlso, as one might expect, social tensions developed between the older and\\r\\nnewer immigrants, and the newer immigrants maintained their identity by\\r\\njoining the Christian Reformed Church. During the decade of heaviest\\r\\nimmigration from the Netherlands (53,000 between 1880-1890), the\\r\\nmembership of the Christian Reformed Church grew from twelve thousand\\r\\nto fifty-three thousand.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn any case, during the whole period of immigration, new arrivals had\\r\\nto choose which denomination they would join. Whatever their choice, the\\r\\nimmigrants used the churches to preserve their religious convictions and\\r\\ninstruct their children along traditional lines. Thus the church and its\\r\\nminister became the crucial core of the Dutch-American community.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Church Talk&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe details of church life &amp;mdash; the coming and going of ministers,\\r\\nelection to church offices, and the building or enlargement of sanctuaries &amp;mdash;\\r\\nappeared constantly in the immigrants\\' correspondence. Perhaps some of\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"115\"&gt;\\r\\nthis \"church talk\" followed a desire to convince relatives in the Netherlands\\r\\nthat immigration had not weakened the faith. Writing directly on that point\\r\\nin 1855, Markus Nienhuis asserted, \"But you must not think that the\\r\\nworship of God is forgotten here. Oh no! I believe, in fact, that it is\\r\\nmaintained better here than in Holland.\" Few correspondents were willing\\r\\nto generalize so broadly as Nienhuis, but most of the immigrants\\r\\ncommented on the quality of their ministers and the importance of church\\r\\nconnections.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe letter of Jan Spoelstra, written shortly after his arrival in 1890,\\r\\nprovides a typical example. He said, \"We enjoy the great blessings of health,\\r\\nfood, and all our necessities, and in addition we are permitted to hear the\\r\\nprecious Word of God proclaimed each Sunday by a true servant of the\\r\\nLord.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nParticipation in church activity was always newsworthy, but\\r\\nimmigrants took special delight in reporting that their children were also\\r\\nactive church members. Klaas Niemeijer was pleased to announce that his\\r\\ndaughter, Henderika, had acquired status as a musician. He wrote, \"When\\r\\nwe have a celebration, she has to sing a solo, the first two lines of every\\r\\nverse, and then the whole class joins in. She sings surprisingly well, and she\\r\\nhas already sung four times in church.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBeing able to announce that a son or brother had become a minister\\r\\nwas probably the most newsworthy event in a Dutch-American family.\\r\\nMaartje Nieveen Smit, in Platte, South Dakota, proudly reported, \"My son,\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I45.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"116\"&gt;\\r\\nSieuwke, is now ready to be a Dominie. He has been home for three\\r\\nmonths, but now he is gone to look at a place where he received a call. It is\\r\\nmiles away. He preaches in English and has studied for nine years. But when\\r\\nhe is home, he prefers to talk Groningers with us.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlthough not quite so prestigious, the marriage of a daughter to a\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I46.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\nminister was also significant news. In that category the children of Willem\\r\\nand Jane Walvoord may have set a record. Reporting these events, the proud\\r\\nmother of the Walvoord girls wrote, \"Our oldest daughter, Drieka, who is\\r\\nmarried to Rev&amp;dot; Klerk, lives in Clymer, New York.... Dillie, who is\\r\\nmarried to Rev&amp;dot; Kuiper, lives in Cedargrove, Wisconsin. There he has the\\r\\nchurch which Klerk had before. Edith, who is married to Professor\\r\\nAnthonie Walvoord, lives in Nagasaki, Japan. There he is the head of an\\r\\nAcademie established by the RCA Foreign Mission Board. They come\\r\\nhome once in seven years.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"117\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWhen describing their new homes, the immigrants almost invariably\\r\\nmeasured the convenience of their location in relation to the church rather\\r\\nthan to the nearest village or city. John Ebbers reported with satisfaction\\r\\nthat a new Dutch church had been organized in his neighborhood. \"There\\r\\nwas,\" he wrote, \"a Holland congregation organized on May 11 by Rev&amp;dot;\\r\\nWijngarden. It is an &lt;i&gt;afgeschijden&lt;/i&gt; church. This is just a short distance away.\\r\\nWe now have the church much closer by.\" After purchasing a farm in\\r\\nHawarden, Iowa, in 1910 Cornelia Kooiman wrote, \"When we move there,\\r\\nwe will be a half hour from church.\" In 1914 J&amp;dot; Den Hartog complained,\\r\\n\"There is a church in Laton, California, but we never go there because they\\r\\nspeak English, and I\\'m not very good at English yet. We always go to\\r\\nHanford, which is 12 miles from us. That is two hours riding, but the roads\\r\\nare good. Sometimes I go alone. The women here do that all the time.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D076\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nEnduring such inconvenience to attend a Holland church\\r\\ndemonstrates piety, but also the need for social contact with other\\r\\nimmigrants. In Fulton, Illinois, F&amp;dot; Sterenberg was able to report a nearly\\r\\nideal situation, which combined all the elements of a comfortable Dutch-American\\r\\nsettlement. In 1885 she wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We live in Fulton, Illinois, about 350 miles from brother Izaak\\r\\nin Michigan. By next spring I will have been married to Frederik\\r\\nSterenberg for 22 years. He is a Groninger &amp;mdash; and for years now he\\r\\nhas been an elder and song leader. We have a Holland congregation&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I47.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"118\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;here of about 150 families, primarily Groningers. We have a fine\\r\\nminister, and we enjoy going to church every Sunday. We live on a\\r\\nfarm about five miles from Fulton. The farm is 248 acres &amp;mdash; cropland\\r\\nand pasture. The largest crops are rye and corn. We sell the straw to\\r\\na paper mill about four miles away. Last year we bought a machine\\r\\nwhich is pulled by three horses, and it bundles the grain in sheaves. It\\r\\ncost $225 and makes the work easy for the boys. All they have to do\\r\\nis stand the sheaves up. We have 8 work horses and 2 colts, 47 beef\\r\\ncattle, 16 milk cows, and 46 pigs. When they are fat, they all go to\\r\\nChicago. That is the great cattle market and they are shipped live. In\\r\\nthe summer I don\\'t have to make butter. There is a creamery here\\r\\nwhich picks up the cream at the house &amp;mdash; and that brings in money\\r\\nevery month.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDutch-Americans consumed but little ink discussing doctrinal\\r\\ndistinctions. For the most part they simply reported that they were\\r\\nattending a Holland church. When inclined to elaborate, they usually\\r\\nargued that their particular denomination was similar to the church they\\r\\nhad attended in the Netherlands. Several immigrants gave the reasons for\\r\\ntheir specific denominational loyalty, but the points of distinction which\\r\\nthey listed were usually symptoms of Americanization rather than\\r\\ncomplicated theological issues.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I48.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"119\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D077\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nEvert Wonnink, while accounting for his church affiliation in 1872,\\r\\nwrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Now I am going to write a little about our congregation. After\\r\\ncareful consideration father and mother also joined the Reformed\\r\\nChurch of America here. This denomination is in agreement with the\\r\\nseceded church of the Netherlands in both teaching and confession.\\r\\nThe congregation consists of some 1200 members. Our minister is the\\r\\nold gray-haired Rev&amp;dot; Vander Meulen. He is 72 years old. He comes\\r\\nfrom Zeeland and was among the first seceders from the Netherlands\\r\\nState Church. Soon he will have to lay down his shepherd staff\\r\\nbecause his diminishing strength does not permit him to serve such a\\r\\nlarge congregation.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We have catechism five times each week. We go to Sunday\\r\\nschool Wednesday evening and Sunday noons. We have about 250\\r\\nattending and 25 teachers. They teach in in both English and\\r\\nDutch &amp;mdash; whichever the students prefer. We do not have a young\\r\\npeople\\'s society here. Last week Wednesday we had a congregational\\r\\nmeeting at which we voted to call a new minister &amp;mdash; Rev&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; E&amp;dot;\\r\\nDosker from Zwolle.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D078\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nJacobus Pietersen, also writing from Grand Rapids, presented his\\r\\nreasons for selecting the &lt;i&gt;Ware Gereformeerde Kerk.&lt;/i&gt; In 1876 he wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Rev&amp;dot; Boer has been called here to be the seminary teacher. You\\r\\nhave probably heard about that by now. Boer is the first full-time\\r\\nteacher we have had in the&lt;/i&gt; Ware Gereformeerde Kerk &lt;i&gt;(Christian\\r\\nReformed Church). The RCA has been doing this for a long time.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Now that I have begun to write about the church, I imagine\\r\\nthat you don\\'t know much about our situation here, so I will give you\\r\\na little information. The RCA here is much like the big church in the\\r\\nNetherlands. The RCA is connected with many American churches.\\r\\nI\\'ve heard there are some 19 different sorts of these churches. You can\\r\\neasily understand that some of us are surprised by this. There are\\r\\nsuch special groups as Methodists, Baptists, Episcopalians and what\\r\\nnot all. Someone could name them all, but not me. But the RCA is\\r\\nconnected with them, and thus you can easily imagine that the\\r\\npreachers can preach just about anything they want. I don\\'t like that.\\r\\nIt is much too lax.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;But we, the CRC, are different. Not that we don\\'t have\\r\\ndifficulties &amp;mdash; because all kinds of people are mixed together here from\\r\\nthe 11 Netherlandic provinces. One feels this way and another wants\\r\\nsomething else. Thus there is much trouble in the congregation. The\\r\\nCRC has about 25 churches, but we don\\'t have an equal number of\\r\\nministers. That\\'s why Rev&amp;dot; Boer was appointed. He has seven\\r\\nstudents.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"120\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I49.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D079\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Two Theological Seminaries&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nRev&amp;dot; Gerrit E&amp;dot; Boer\\'s appointment as seminary professor in Grand\\r\\nRapids marked the origins of Calvin Theological Seminary. This school,\\r\\nfounded in 1876 to train the ministers of the Christian Reformed Church,\\r\\nwas the second theological school established by the nineteenth-century\\r\\nimmigrants. Western Theological Seminary in Holland, Michigan, started\\r\\ntraining ministers in 1866 and by 1869 had gained official status as a\\r\\nseminary of the Reformed Church in America. These two theological\\r\\nschools, together with their undergraduate departments, have guided the\\r\\ndenominations which gave them birth.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe older of the two institutions, Hope College and Western\\r\\nTheological Seminary, owes its existence to A&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Van Raalte. He donated\\r\\nthe land on which the first buildings were constructed, and he negotiated\\r\\nwith synodical representatives to acquire denominational sanction and\\r\\nfinancial support for his school. Drawing upon well-trained ministers and\\r\\nteachers from the Americanized segment of the Reformed Church in\\r\\nAmerica, Van Raalte\\'s school acquired a competent teaching staff. In 1869\\r\\nRev&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; Zwemer, one of the school\\'s first students, described the institution\\r\\nfor his friend, Helenius De Cock&amp;dot; Zwemer wrote,\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;After living about six years in Rochester, New York, we have\\r\\nmoved to the colony of Holland so that I could do my preparatory\\r\\nstudies there in the Academy. During the time that I attended, John&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"121\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I50.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Van Vleck was the principal of the school and its first teacher. In my\\r\\nsecond year A&amp;dot; Thompson was appointed the second teacher. Now\\r\\nRev&amp;dot; Phelps, an American, has replaced Van Vleck and a Hollander,\\r\\nG&amp;dot; Vander Wall, is the second teacher. There are about 40 students.\\r\\nThey receive lessons in Greek, Hebrew, German, and English &amp;mdash;\\r\\nmath, chemistry, and philosophy. That is the school.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlthough Van Raalte sought teachers from the Netherlands, few were\\r\\nwilling to immigrate. Thus, throughout the whole of the nineteenth\\r\\ncentury, only five of the school\\'s instructors were immigrants. Thirteen\\r\\nothers, including all of the school\\'s presidents, were born and educated in\\r\\nAmerica. Thus the influence of American church life and education came\\r\\nquickly to Hope College and Western Theological Seminary. Still, the\\r\\ninfluence of Dutch theology remained strong throughout the century. The\\r\\nimmigrant ministers &amp;mdash; Van Raalte, Vander Meulen, Bolks, de Beij, Klijn,\\r\\nand Dosker &amp;mdash; were powerful leaders in the western segment of their\\r\\ndenomination, and they influenced the character of both their churches and\\r\\nthe seminary. All these ministers, however, were products of the &lt;i&gt;Afscheiding&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\nin the Netherlands, which, because of its pietistic character, absorbed\\r\\nAmerican pietism with little difficulty. The &lt;i&gt;Doleantie,&lt;/i&gt; with its more broadly\\r\\ncultural concept of Christianity, arrived too late to reorient the thinking of\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"122\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I51.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\nVan Raalte and his colleagues.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe Christian Reformed Church, which dates from 1857, also\\r\\noriginated under the influence of the &lt;i&gt;Afscheiding,&lt;/i&gt; but this denomination\\r\\nenjoyed its greatest period of growth after 1880. Many of its new members\\r\\nwere immigrants who came from the &lt;i&gt;Gereformeerde Kerken&lt;/i&gt; in the\\r\\nNetherlands. By joining the Christian Reformed Church in such large\\r\\nnumbers, they substantially altered its character. They also encouraged\\r\\nchanges in the quality of its seminary. Founded in 1876, Calvin Theological\\r\\nSeminary came quickly under Abraham Kuyper\\'s influence. Throughout the\\r\\nnineteenth century the school drew its instructors from the Netherlands.\\r\\nThe first four professors were trained at Kampen and emphasized the\\r\\ndoctrinal concerns of the &lt;i&gt;Afscheiding.&lt;/i&gt; But Geerhardus Vos, who came to the\\r\\nschool in 1890, carried fresh ideas to Grand Rapids. He had developed\\r\\nstrong attachments to Abraham Kuyper while studying in the Netherlands,\\r\\nand became Kuyper\\'s American spokesman. The introduction of Kuyperian\\r\\nprinciples caused considerable controversy in the seminary and church. The\\r\\nolder ministers, L&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Hulst, G&amp;dot; Boer, W&amp;dot; Hemkes, and F&amp;dot; Ten Hoor, resisted\\r\\nthis new infusion of Dutch theology.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D080\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Abraham Kuyper: Influence from Abroad&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nRev&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Vander Mey, who studied under Geerhardus Vos, wrote a letter\\r\\nto Abraham Kuyper in 1896, paying tribute to his intellectual father:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Almost all the ministers of our church who were educated in\\r\\nAmerica embrace your principles. This has two causes. First, the\\r\\neducation under Boer and Hemkes was in every sense poor. After the\\r\\ngraduates became ministers, they felt the lack of sound knowledge,\\r\\nand when they entered their congregations, they tried to improve&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"123\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;themselves through continued study. And what did they use? They\\r\\nused the works of Abraham Kuyper! Secondly, those who were\\r\\neducated by Dr&amp;dot; Geerhardus Vos have come to your side as a\\r\\nconsequence of the powerful training they enjoyed under Dr&amp;dot; Vos&amp;dot; Dr&amp;dot;\\r\\nVos led us to Dr&amp;dot; Kuyper.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I also acquired my training from Dr&amp;dot; Vos&amp;dot; Thus, I too have\\r\\nbecome an admirer of Dr&amp;dot; Kuyper. Please excuse me, dear teacher,\\r\\nthat I proclaim my inner feelings to you. I can never tell you how\\r\\nlarge a place you occupy in my heart. But, how can it be otherwise? I\\r\\nread almost everything you write.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAs Vander Mey\\'s letter suggests, many of the older ministers schooled\\r\\nat Kampen rejected the new views, but in the long run Kuyper\\'s influence\\r\\nprevailed. Although G&amp;dot; Vos left Grand Rapids to join the theological\\r\\nseminary of Princeton in New Jersey, many students followed him to receive\\r\\npost-graduate instruction. Many others traveled to the Netherlands and\\r\\nattended the Free University of Amsterdam. Between 1902 and 1948 twelve\\r\\ninstructors were appointed to the faculty of Calvin Seminary; and all but\\r\\none of these attended the Free University or Princeton, where Geerhardus\\r\\nVos continued teaching until 1932. Thus Abraham Kuyper did not lack\\r\\ndisciples in the New World. Nor were his admirers confined to the\\r\\nChristian Reformed Church.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D081\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNicholas M&amp;dot; Steffens, a professor at Western Theological Seminary in\\r\\nHolland, Michigan, also supported Kuyperian ideas. He maintained\\r\\nconnections with G&amp;dot; Vos in Grand Rapids and corresponded frequently with\\r\\nAbraham Kuyper. Both Steffens and Vos had difficulty persuading their\\r\\ncolleagues to adopt Kuyperian views. Writing to Kuyper about this problem\\r\\nin 1891, Steffens said:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Dr&amp;dot; Vos has a more conservative surrounding than I, but he is\\r\\nunderstood by his colleagues &amp;mdash; even though these well-meaning people\\r\\nare poorly educated and narrow minded. Momentarily Vos is plagued\\r\\nin the Wachter because of his supralapsarian viewpoint. Actually,\\r\\nRev&amp;dot; Hulst is not concerned with Vos\\'s views, but he uses Vos to\\r\\nattack you. It is a pity that the young man, Vos, wastes his power in\\r\\nsuch a place. Had he stayed in the Netherlands, he could have\\r\\ncontributed much more. He is no leader of public affairs, but he is\\r\\nconscientious and works diligently. There is nothing but praise to be\\r\\nsaid for his principles. I love him.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nOf his own circumstances, Steffens wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Even our own paper,&lt;/i&gt; The Hope, &lt;i&gt;is in the hands of a clique\\r\\nwhich does everything to prevent me from explaining Reformed\\r\\nprinciples. I have a group of articles in my file which have been\\r\\nrejected by the editorial committee. Sometimes I don\\'t know what to\\r\\ndo. It is obvious that here in this \"free\" America, you can find&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"124\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;tyranny which opposes the work of the Lord.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn general Steffens regarded the American setting as inhospitable to\\r\\nReformed and Kuyperian influences. Apparently A&amp;dot; Kuyper considered the\\r\\npossibility of leading a group of immigrants to America in the 1880s, but\\r\\nSteffens advised strenuously against this:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I can understand how you may think that it might be better to\\r\\nlead your Reformed people to Africa or North America, but don\\'t\\r\\ngive it serious thought. There is little in America to offer hope, even\\r\\nthough I would personally love to have you and your people among\\r\\nus.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I know the strife is fierce, but you have a better prospect for\\r\\nsuccess in the Netherlands than here in America. We are on a path\\r\\nhere which you would have to struggle against.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I say it confidentially, but it is true, that in the Presbyterian\\r\\nand Reformed Churches of America the modern and conciliatory\\r\\nspirit is spreading quickly. When you try to oppose this spirit, the\\r\\ncolumns of the newspapers are closed to you. Not long ago I\\r\\nattempted to get something printed in the&lt;/i&gt; New York Observer &lt;i&gt;in an\\r\\neffort to oppose the violation of the doctrine of justification by faith\\r\\ncaused by the new evangelical methods, but the door was closed.\\r\\nThus it is so, that as foreigners, the Hollanders can exercise little\\r\\ninfluence over the theological developments of the nation. They are\\r\\neither lost within the nation, or they remain strangers &amp;mdash; protesting\\r\\nagainst all things American.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nPerceptively, Steffens raised the central issue facing all immigrant\\r\\ngroups in America, and among Dutch-Americans the debate over\\r\\nAmericanization has continued to the present. Vander Mey expressed the\\r\\nnature of that dilemma with exceptional clarity. Writing to A&amp;dot; Kuyper in\\r\\n1896, Vander Mey complained:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;As Reformed Christians we face a dark future here in America.\\r\\nPeople in the Netherlands have no idea how the whole of America\\r\\ndrinks from the fountains of Methodism, and the young people in our\\r\\nchurch also lean in that direction. We scarcely know how to preserve\\r\\nthem. If, as many prefer, we choose to remain isolated as Hollanders,\\r\\nwe will be signing our own death warrants. But the other option &amp;mdash;\\r\\nswift Americanization &amp;mdash; often results in more disastrous\\r\\nconsequences.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDutch Americans have found no single answer to Vander Mey\\'s\\r\\ndilemma, but with varying success they have attempted to retain what they\\r\\nconsider best in their ethnic tradition. Among those whose Netherlandic\\r\\nroots are most directly connected with the &lt;i&gt;Afscheiding&lt;/i&gt; of the 1830s,\\r\\nAmericanization is more complete. For these Dutch-Americans the church\\r\\nconstitutes the most direct link with an ethnic past. But, as we have seen,\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"125\"&gt;\\r\\nthe &lt;i&gt;Afscheiding&lt;/i&gt; was a simpler and more narrow interpretation of Christian\\r\\nlife than was the &lt;i&gt;Doleantie.&lt;/i&gt; Thus the &lt;i&gt;Afscheiding,&lt;/i&gt; with its concern for piety\\r\\nand pure doctrine, could more readily adapt to American society. The\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Afgescheidenen&lt;/i&gt; were also among the earliest immigrants, and their\\r\\ndescendants have had more time to adjust their views to the American\\r\\ncontext.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDutch immigrants attached to the &lt;i&gt;Doleantie&lt;/i&gt; have approached the\\r\\nproblem of Americanization more aggressively than those who arrived\\r\\nbefore the 1880s. Although willing to join American society, many of\\r\\nAbraham Kuyper\\'s followers hoped to influence the institutions of North\\r\\nAmerica by establishing separate schools, labor unions, political parties,\\r\\nand newspapers. They believed that Christians outside of the Dutch-American\\r\\ncommunity could be attracted to these institutions. But, aside\\r\\nfrom the Christian school, these efforts have enjoyed small success.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe Christian school, however, has continued to grow, supported by\\r\\nboth a Holland and a general American constituency. Christian Schools\\r\\nInternational, an organization that encompasses more than three hundred\\r\\nschools and more than sixty thousand students, has attempted to preserve\\r\\npart of the Kuyperian view in American society. Staffed primarily by\\r\\ngraduates of Dutch-American colleges, the Christian schools attempt to\\r\\nlead successive generations along paths that originate from both the\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Afscheiding&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Doleantie.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis dual tradition has been the source of some tension in the Dutch-American\\r\\ncommunity. The western congregations of the Reformed Church\\r\\nin America, those that originated in Van Raalte\\'s era, have emphasized\\r\\npersonal piety and doctrinal purity more than the eastern segment of the\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I52.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"126\"&gt;\\r\\ndenomination; while the doctrinal-pietistic traditions of the Christian\\r\\nReformed Church have blunted the influence of Abraham Kuyper\\'s\\r\\nDoleantie. Additional complications have arisen from the American\\r\\ncontext in which those churches have developed. Nonetheless, both\\r\\ndenominations continue to bear the clear imprint of their Netherlandic\\r\\norigins.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D082\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFor rather obvious reasons nineteenth-century Holland-American\\r\\nimmigrants have experienced relatively few difficulties in their adopted land.\\r\\nFirst, they were northern Europeans whose appearance and general values\\r\\ndiffered little from the dominant Anglo-American cultural establishment.\\r\\nEven more significantly, Netherlanders had been present in North America\\r\\nsince the early seventeenth century, and their descendants made the\\r\\nnewcomers less conspicuous. These new immigrants also benefited from the\\r\\ntradition of acceptability and the achievements established by their\\r\\nseventeenth-century forerunners. Further, because their names were easily\\r\\nconfused with those of the original Dutch families, they acquired some of\\r\\nthe prestige which the older families enjoyed as founders and original\\r\\nsettlers.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn the United States only the English enjoyed similarly prestigious\\r\\norigins. The Spanish and French were less acceptable because of their\\r\\nCatholicism, and all other large groups of Europeans arrived after the\\r\\nAnglo-American patterns had been established. By contrast, Netherlanders\\r\\nhad preceded many English colonists, and the Dutch created their own\\r\\ncultural hegemony in New Amsterdam. Even after the English captured the\\r\\nDutch colony in 1664, immigrants arriving in that area frequently\\r\\nconformed to the Netherlandic cultural setting. Swedes, Germans, and even\\r\\nsome of the English were forced to adopt the Dutch language in order to\\r\\nconduct business. As late as the 1840s, when the \"new\" immigration began,\\r\\nfresh arrivals easily encountered Dutch-speaking guides and advisers in New\\r\\nYork and New Jersey.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlong with all these advantages Holland-Americans constituted so\\r\\nsmall a minority in North America that they never threatened an already-established\\r\\ncultural pattern. By contrast, the Irish entered Boston in such\\r\\nlarge numbers that they threatened and eventually captured political power\\r\\nfrom the old Anglo-American elite. Nineteenth-century Holland-Americans\\r\\ndid dominate whole regions of Michigan, Iowa, and elsewhere,\\r\\nbut they generally acquired open or sparsely populated districts, thus\\r\\nreducing the potential for cultural clash and competition.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHolland-Americans have resisted total Americanization by choice and\\r\\nnot because they were unwelcome in the centers of American life. In fact, it\\r\\nhas been easy for Dutch-Americans to drift into the mainstream of\\r\\nAmerican culture because they have always been there. Names like De\\r\\nVries, Roosevelt, Vander Bilt, and De Witt were common and frequently\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"127\"&gt;\\r\\nprestigious when the nineteenth-century immigration began. While Poles,\\r\\nItalians, and Jews have been tempted to Anglicize their names to gain\\r\\nacceptance in American society, Hollanders have felt little pressure in that\\r\\ndirection. Peter De Vries, a best-selling American novelist, but also the son\\r\\nof a nineteenth-century immigrant, has utilized the confusion connected\\r\\nwith distinguishing the \"old\" Dutch families from the \"new\" to create a\\r\\ndelightful scene in his novel, &lt;i&gt;The Blood of the Lamb.&lt;/i&gt; In this somewhat\\r\\nautobiographical story, De Vries, thinly veiled as the main character,\\r\\nWanderhope, crashes high American social circles in Chicago because the\\r\\n\"Americans\" easily confuse his name with those of the New York elite.\\r\\nWhen the Chicago socialite Mrs&amp;dot; Winkler asks, \"Have you ever been\\r\\nabroad?\" Wanderhope answers, \"No, but my parents have. They\\'ve spent\\r\\nmany years in Europe.\" And, of course, before emigrating to Chicago,\\r\\nwhere he became a garbage collector, De Vries\\'s father had indeed spent\\r\\n\"many years in Europe.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt is true that Dutch family names often appear in lists of prestigious\\r\\nAmericans; virtually every chronicler of Dutch-American history will cite\\r\\nthe three Presidents Martin Van Buren, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin\\r\\nD&amp;dot; Roosevelt, together with Senator Arthur Vanden Berg. And books like\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Hollanders Who Helped Build America&lt;/i&gt; (1942), by H&amp;dot; M&amp;dot; Viekke and H&amp;dot;\\r\\nBeets,&lt;note ref=\"3\"&gt;3 &lt;i&gt;This book contains biographical sketches for more than five hundred living Dutch-Americans.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt; demonstrate that Holland-Americans have become prominent\\r\\nmembers of every profession in America. But it is difficult to determine\\r\\nwhat degree of ethnic consciousness these people have retained; the specific\\r\\ncharacter of their contributions seldom bears a direct relationship to their\\r\\nnational origin.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHolland-Americans have probably had the strongest influence on\\r\\nAmerican culture in the are of religious affairs. In the long run, for\\r\\nexample, the influence of the immigrant preacher T&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Frelinghuysen has\\r\\nbeen vastly greater than that of Governor Peter Stuyvesant. As a principal\\r\\ninitiator of the religious movement known as the Great Awakening\\r\\n(1720-1760), Frelinghuysen, who carried his pietism from the Netherlands,\\r\\nused it to influence the character of the American religious revival. The\\r\\nconsequences of that influence can be readily observed in the activity of\\r\\nBilly Graham.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe impact of the nineteenth-century immigration remains less clear;\\r\\nbut because they occupy identifiable regions in Michigan, Iowa, and\\r\\nelsewhere, these Holland-Americans have preserved a sufficient level of\\r\\nethnic identity to influence the larger American community. Still, aside\\r\\nfrom a few isolated cases, the success of prominent individuals usually stems\\r\\nfrom that person\\'s activity as an American rather than as a Dutch-American.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBy contrast, institutions frequently preserve pure ethnic traits.\\r\\nChurches, schools, hospitals, and homes for the aged, which spring from\\r\\nand support the ethnic family and its values, are able to enlarge a small\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"128\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I53.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\ncommunity\\'s sphere of influence more effectively than the ordinary\\r\\nindividual can. For example, an educational institution like Calvin College\\r\\nin Grand Rapids, Michigan, has already provided leadership among other\\r\\nchurch-related schools who reject the views of our post-Christian world but\\r\\nwish for more than mere survival through isolation. It is the influence of\\r\\nAbraham Kuyper\\'s &lt;i&gt;Doleantie&lt;/i&gt; which has strengthened the capacity of Calvin\\r\\nCollege to provide leadership in examining the cultural dimensions of\\r\\nChristianity in America.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn recent years the growth potential for ethnic survival in the United\\r\\nStates has increased. Although the causes of this development are not easily\\r\\nidentified, they relate to a general lack of self-confidence in the centers of\\r\\nAmerican power and influence. Problems (the riots in the 1960s, the\\r\\nVietnam War, and political corruption) have forced many opinion leaders to\\r\\nreconsider their faith in progress, because the foundation of that faith seems\\r\\nless secure. First, the supposedly unlimited supply of cheap raw material,\\r\\nupon which America\\'s wide-spread consumer economy depends, seems to be\\r\\ndwindling. Up to this moment no technological \"miracle\" has appeared to\\r\\nsignificantly alter the source or amount of available energy which feeds the\\r\\nconsumption ethos. Also, it has become increasingly evident that the\\r\\ninstitutions of democracy have not improved either the moral or intellectual\\r\\nqualities of the populace and its leaders.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNaive though it may seem, the American Dream has been built upon\\r\\nthe twin foundations of economic and moral progress. The keystone of this\\r\\nedifice has been the public schools, which were urged to draw all people &amp;mdash;\\r\\nblack and white; Protestant, Catholic, and Jew &amp;mdash; into a great melting pot.\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"129\"&gt;\\r\\nFrom this crucible educational leaders hoped to forge a new humanity whose\\r\\ncommon faith in the ideals and institutions of democracy would transcend\\r\\nall ethnic and religious difference. The rewards of this new faith were socio-economic\\r\\nadvancement, and those who believed and lived in accord with\\r\\nthe \"American Way\" were promised success.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDuring the past two centuries many European immigrants have been\\r\\neconomically successful. They have become landowners and homeowners,\\r\\nand their children have progressed to careers in business and well-paid\\r\\nprofessions. But the potential for continued advancement of this sort seems\\r\\nto be clogging up. Hard work no longer leads automatically to improved\\r\\nliving standards. Diplomas do not insure entrance into desired professions.\\r\\nMore significantly still, those who have succeeded often find the\\r\\nmeaninglessness of their lives a source of discontent.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt seems probable that the cause of this disillusionment rests upon the\\r\\nrelatively scant cultural tapestry offered in the American Dream. By\\r\\nconcentrating the core of American values in political theories born in the\\r\\neighteenth century, by defining social status within the narrow band of\\r\\nmaterial consumption, American culture has offered too little substance for\\r\\nhuman satisfaction or fulfillment. One compensatory reaction to these\\r\\nlimited cultural currents may be an intensified adherence to ethnic values\\r\\nand traditions &amp;mdash; a phenomenon which many American scholars and\\r\\njournalists have discussed recently.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe research of three prominent authors (D&amp;dot; P&amp;dot; Moynihan, J&amp;dot;\\r\\nHigham, and M&amp;dot; Gordon&lt;note ref=\"4\"&gt;4 &lt;i&gt;Daniel P&amp;dot; Moynihan and Nathan Glazer,&lt;/i&gt; Beyond The Melting Pot &lt;i&gt;(Cambridge, Mass&amp;dot;: M&amp;dot;I&amp;dot;T&amp;dot;\\r\\nPress, 1963); Milton Gordon,&lt;/i&gt; Assimilation in American Life &lt;i&gt;(New York: Oxford Univ&amp;dot; Press,\\r\\n1968); John Higham,&lt;/i&gt; Send Me These &lt;i&gt;(New York: Athenium, 1975).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;) has confirmed the suspicion that the melting\\r\\npot formula has not dissolved America\\'s ethnic groups and that the\\r\\nimmigrants and their descendants have maintained loyalties to both their\\r\\nEuropean and American traditions. Thus, the prospect of a continuing and\\r\\nvital ethnic awareness remains strong.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBut more recently, in the 1980\\'s, the astounding growth of the\\r\\nHispanic-American community (currently about 23 million) has rekindled\\r\\ndemands for cultural conformity.&lt;note ref=\"5\"&gt;5 &lt;i&gt;Rudolph Vercoli \"The Return of the Melting Pot: Ethnicity in the United States in the Eighties.\"&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\nJournal of the American Ethnic History, &lt;i&gt;Fall 1985, pages 9-19.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt; It is doubtful, though, that the general\\r\\ninterest in ethnic studies will give way to the extreme pressure for cultural\\r\\nconformity which prevailed between 1917 and 1950. Cultural pluralism will\\r\\nprobably continue to flourish as a balancing force to cultural homogeneity.\\r\\nIn any case each generation of Americans has been inclined to reexamine\\r\\nthe age-old question \"What is an American?\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe answer to that query has never been static because the populace\\r\\nhas been in constant fluctuation. But, by merely raising the question, fresh\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"130\"&gt;\\r\\nconsiderations arise. Among those is the possibility that America is and\\r\\nmust continue to be a pluralistic society composed of ethnic groups who can\\r\\nmake their best contributions to the general welfare by maintaining some\\r\\nnon-American values and traditions. If this is a viable model for American\\r\\nlife, the Holland-American community deserves careful scrutiny; it has\\r\\nstaked out a remarkably large territory for the continued cultivation of its\\r\\nethnic heritage.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div1&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/text&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/lad&gt;\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

The English, Spanish, and Netherlanders who explored the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nregion came first. They established trading centers such as New\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAmsterdam and Boston on the fringes of the continent during the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nseventeenth century.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nSince that time \\&mdash; in fact, since Henry Hudson\\textbackslash{}'s exploration in 1609 \\&mdash;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nNetherlanders have had continuous connection with North America. New\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nNetherlands, the colony the Dutch founded in 1615, survived until the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBritish conquest of 1664. At that time about seven thousand Netherlanders\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlived in New Amsterdam and the surrounding area. Few new immigrants\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom the mother country joined them until the nineteenth century, when\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe most massive population migration in modern times occurred.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBetween 1820 and 1920 more than thirty million Europeans\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmigrated to the United States, but of these less than 1 percent were\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nNetherlanders. Unlike the Irish, Germans, and others, the Netherlanders\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndid not desert their homeland in frenzied massive waves. The first\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsignificant emigration, guided by A\\&dot; C\\&dot; Van Raalte, H\\&dot; P\\&dot; Scholte, and C\\&dot;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nVander Meulen, was planned with great care. And after arriving in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAmerica, these first immigrants mailed detailed reports of their experience\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto families and friends in the mother country. These letters indicate that few\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmigrants from Holland entered the New World blindly.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIn 1846, the year that A\\&dot; C\\&dot; Van Raalte led a group of emigrants from\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nArnhem to Michigan, emigration from the Netherlands totaled about two\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthousand. That same year fifty thousand Germans migrated to North\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAmerica. Many of these passed through the Netherlands en route to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"10\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nRotterdam and Amsterdam, and some arrived on the Dutch coast without\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nenough money to pay for their passage. They became dependents of the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDutch government. Trekking along the roads and rivers of Holland, the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nGerman migrants sparked considerable interest among the poor folk in the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nNetherlands, but few actually joined the German throng.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAfter the reports from the followers of Van Raalte, Scholte, and others\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nreached the Netherlands, the people began to emigrate in larger numbers,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand between 1881 and 1890 that movement peaked at 53,701. Thus, even\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nduring its crest, emigration from the Netherlands was miniscule compared\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto the movement from Germany, Poland, and elsewhere.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAmericans, whatever their country of origin, retain a lingering but\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nvague acquaintance with the events surrounding the immigration of their\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nancestors. Tales of hardship, followed by success or disappointment, abound.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIn recent years many third- and fourth-generation Americans have become\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnewly interested in the details of the immigration experience. Although this\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnew concern may have arisen in reaction to black chauvinism in the 1960s,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit has developed into a positive force encouraged and supported by the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnational government. \"Ethnic Studies\" have become popular in the schools\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand bookstores of America.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nTo encourage this interest in national origins, the Bentley Historical\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nLibrary of the University of Michigan sent scholars to Europe in search of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe correspondence written by the immigrants of the last century. While\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nother historians investigated the archives of Ireland, Finland, and Poland, I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nreceived financial assistance enabling me to locate letters written by\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nemigrants from the Netherlands. During six months in 1976, I was able to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlocate and photocopy about 1,400 immigrant letters. Some of these letters\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwere publicly available prior to my search; but I discovered a majority of this\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncorrespondence in the attics, cupboards, and bookshelves of private homes\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand farms. Until now, these pages have not been available for public\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nexamination.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDiscovering these letters was a great adventure that led me to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhundreds of cities and villages in the Netherlands. Throughout the process I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nenjoyed help and encouragement from many people in Holland.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nExperiencing their open-hearted hospitality was an exceptional pleasure.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nLike many other Americans, I have always been aware of my ethnic\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nheritage, and as a historian I have read most of the available literature on\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDutch-American history. But the experience of living and working among\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe people who embody my own European heritage has enriched the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmeaning of my study. One hundred and four years after my great-grandfather\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmigrated from Drenthe, I was able to visit his birthplace, walk the streets\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof his youth, and meet the descendants of his neighbors. No book,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nphotograph, or motion picture can equal the intimacy and satisfaction of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthat experience.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHistorians use many sources in their attempts to recreate the past.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nSome of these, such as minutes of organizations and governmental reports,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"11\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyield a rich harvest of data but lack lively human qualities and often reduce\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe vitality of experience to relatively bloodless generalizations. I believe\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthat the letters the immigrants wrote constitute the best source for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nrediscovering the spirit and character of the immigration.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThis book attempts to provide some essential background for the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nletters, while allowing the immigrants to speak for themselves. Thus, the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nscope of this story is circumscribed by the availability of immigrant\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncorrespondence. Fortunately, I was able to discover letters from every major\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDutch-American settlement in the United States. But for some localities,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nparticularly New Jersey, a larger number of letters would have been\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndesirable. In any case, the correspondence portrays the full range of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmigrant experience: ocean travel, wilderness beginnings, life in the cities,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand the formation of distinctly Dutch-American institutions in a foreign\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nland. Through all this the immigrants remained deeply interested in the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nland of their birth. Their correspondence illustrates the validity of a proverb\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthey often cited, \"Het bloed kruipt waar het niet gaan kan.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWhile acquiring the letters which constitute the heart of this book, I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhave accumulated a mountain of debt \\&mdash; that is, I owe gratitude to literally\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndozens of Netherlanders. I wish to express appreciation particularly to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nseveral very helpful friends. No one gave me more time, sound advice, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndelightful companionship than the late Mr\\&dot; G\\&dot; H\\&dot; Ligterink. Together we\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntraveled the small roads of the <i>achterhoek</i> and visited dozens of families.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nFrom them we acquired many of the most interesting letters in this\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncollection. Professor H\\&dot; J\\&dot; Prakke and Mr\\&dot; G\\&dot; J\\&dot; H\\&dot; Kroessenbrink arranged\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na fruitful newspaper and radio publicity for my search. Others, such as G\\&dot;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBrands, Jr\\&dot; and J\\&dot; G\\&dot; Ter Horst, arranged meetings and spoke for me when I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconfronted dialects too complicated for my limited language skills. Just over\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe border in Bentheim, the Gerhard Hensen family assisted me generously.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWhile in Drenthe, the pleasant hours and letters I shared with the late J\\&dot; S\\&dot;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWilting remain precious to me. J\\&dot; A\\&dot; Niemeijer, who led me to a publisher\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand the hospitality of his home, will always remain my friend. Our\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nneighbors in Heerde, Mr\\&dot; and Mrs\\&dot; Jan Driesten, provided valuable\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nassistance to me, but even more important, they gave their hearts and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhands to me and my family. To all of these I wish to express deep\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nappreciation.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThroughout the Netherlands, from Middelburg to Leeuwarden,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}narchivists and librarians provided helpful assistance and sound advice.

Rev\\&dot; H\\&dot; P\\&dot; Scholte\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nchartered three ships to transport nine hundred of his followers to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBaltimore; from there they traveled inland to the prairies of Iowa.

Several of the first ships\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsailed to New Orleans, expecting to avoid overland travel in America by\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfollowing the Mississippi River northward; but they quickly discovered that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe swift current of the Mississippi hindered rapid travel. Thereafter most\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nemigrants sailed directly to harbors on the Eastern seaboard. Of these, New\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nYork was favored because it provided ready access to the Erie Canal, which\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nled to Buffalo, New York.

They scattered in all directions: Allegan, Grand\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHaven, and Grand Rapids. Among these, Grand Rapids offered the best\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nopportunities for employment. In addition, a pious Zeelander named H\\&dot;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nVan Driel had already organized a Dutch-language worship service there in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n1848. Thus, only one year after Van Raalte\\textbackslash{}'s people occupied the wooded\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nshore of Black Lake, Van Driel was reading Dutch sermons to an audience\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhich included over one hundred young women who were providing\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndomestic service among the American families of Grand Rapids. By 1851, it\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nis estimated that a total of four hundred Hollanders were living in Grand\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nRapids.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<head>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<b>Michigan Background</b>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</head>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe Netherlanders who settled in western Michigan were, of course,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnot the first Europeans to investigate that corner of the North American\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwilderness. As early as 1620 the French had used this area to trade with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIndian tribes. And in 1688 Father Jacques Marquette, a missionary-explorer,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfounded a permanent village at Saulte Sainte Marie. Since other French\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmissionaries organized mission stations all along the coast of Lake\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMichigan, it\\textbackslash{}'s not surprising that in 1847 Van Raalte and his followers met a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntribe of Christian Indians on the future site of Holland, Michigan.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMichigan afforded Van Raalte a better opportunity to isolate his\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncolony than did the neighboring states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, all of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhich had been settled and organized earlier than the Wolverine State.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nSince Michigan did not gain independent statehood until 1837, Van Raalte\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwas able to acquire large tracts of unsettled land for his group.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWhy was Michigan so slow to develop? Many people were scared off\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nby the surveyors\\textbackslash{}' reports in 1812. After describing a territory that consisted\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof swamps, lakes, and poor sandy soil not worth the cost of additional\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninvestigation, these reports asserted, \"Not more than one acre in a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhundred... would admit of cultivation.\" It was further assumed that such\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na region would be very unhealthy for human occupation.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAlthough these reports had been proven false by the time Van Raalte\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}narrived in Detroit seeking a place to found his colony, Van Raalte\\textbackslash{}'s followers\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwould soon be able to attest that there was more than a grain of truth in the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nearly surveyors\\textbackslash{}' words: some regions, including much of the land\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsurrounding Holland, Michigan, <i>were</i> swampy areas which could not be\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nutilized for many years.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nVan Raalte\\textbackslash{}'s efforts in Holland, Michigan, paralleled similar efforts\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}namong his American neighbors. The towns and villages in the colony\\textbackslash{}'s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmediate vicinity were all youthful and crude, having origins as trading\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"27\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nposts or Indian settlements. Port Sheldon, the colony\\textbackslash{}'s nearest neighbor,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhad been developed in 1837 for reasons much like those which Van Raalte\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncherished in selecting Holland. Like Holland, Port Sheldon had access to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nLake Michigan through an adjoining inland lake that provided a potential\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nharbor. But Port Sheldon had been organized by speculators who hoped to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlure purchasers with the promise of spiraling land values. The founders\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconstructed a huge hotel on the site and had already sold some of the town\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlots when the economic crisis of 1837 pulled land values down and forced\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe town\\textbackslash{}'s developers into bankruptcy. Van Raalte proceeded more wisely.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHis colony consisted of settlers, not empty projections of speculative wealth.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nVan Raalte\\textbackslash{}'s experiment was, however, rather unique. Americans did\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnot expect fresh European immigrants to settle in the wilderness. That, they\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncommonly believed, was the peculiar task of the tough American\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrontiersmen. In 1831 Alexis de Tocqueville, the well-known author of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<i>Democracy in America,</i> recorded this typical view in the words of a Michigan\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrontiersman. Asked why so few recent European immigrants could be found\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin the Michigan wilderness, the frontiersman replied:\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<bl>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<i>None but the Americans are brave enough to submit to such\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nprivation, and are willing to pay such a price for {[}success{]}.

Interestingly, the main contours of that story exhibit\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npatterns similar to those of other successful frontier settlements. In 1846,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith about one hundred companions, Rev\\&dot; Albertus C\\&dot; Van Raalte migrated\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom Arnhem in the Dutch province of Gelderland to Detroit, Michigan.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBecause the Great Lakes channels froze early in 1846, Van Raalte\\textbackslash{}'s party\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nremained in Detroit for the winter.

After abandoning his preference for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWisconsin, Van Raalte traveled to western Michigan and joined company\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith Judge John R\\&dot; Kellogg from Allegan. Together they viewed lands along\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe Grand River and the area surrounding Black Lake. After considerable\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninvestigation, Van Raalte decided to purchase some four thousand acres on\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe fringes of Black Lake, for he was convinced that its access to Lake\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMichigan would facilitate the development of a busy harbor port. To achieve\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nall this, Van Raalte used funds from his own purse and from associates in the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nNetherlands, but he also acquired loans from sympathetic supporters in New\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nYork.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe earliest efforts at colony building were attended by back-breaking\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlabor, hunger, and much grief.

Despite these setbacks, the immigrants were hopeful and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}noccasionally euphoric about the future of the colony.

At about 9 o\\textbackslash{}'clock in the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmorning he died. He was delicate and weak and could neither walk\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnor speak yet. We have had many difficulties with him; he was very\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsmall, and had a very weak chest so that he would never have been a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nstrong fellow.

Winter is late\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthis year and without snow our work progresses nicely. The cows\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ngraze in the woods and deer hunters are also all around.

Some were built this\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsummer, and the people who plan to live here are cutting trees in the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwoods. There is also a very large church here in Zeeland, with a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmembership of at least 400 souls. The building is already too small\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbecause 30 or 40 people can\\textbackslash{}'t find a place to sit on Sundays.</i>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</bl>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAs immigrants continued to settle in western Michigan, the original\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nvillages of the colony, such as Drenthe and Vriesland, filled up. Already in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe 1870s new arrivals were forced to find land on the fringes of the colony.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThus Blendon, located twelve miles north of Zeeland, became the home of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe Avink brothers. There they undertook the arduous task of clearing land\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand accumulating farm machinery and livestock.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHarm Avink remained in Blendon until 1906. Because he was not a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwealthy immigrant, his oldest daughter worked among neighboring farmers\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nas a housemaid for \\$2.75 per week. Later, she married a factory worker, who\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAvink claimed earned high wages in a Grand Rapids railroad yard. In 1889\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAvink was able to increase the size of his farm, but again he faced the back-breaking\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntask of cutting trees and grubbing stumps. Finally, in 1901, he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nreported that farming had become much easier since the stumps and roots\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhad been removed. By then he had also joined a marketing cooperative and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwas earning \\$200 annually for his dairy products. He sold his potato crop in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nGrand Rapids and noted that pickles and sugar beets could be sold in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHolland, where factories to process these crops had been established.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAvink\\textbackslash{}'s life, however, was no broad path from pauper to large\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlandholder. That he did not acquire a larger tract of land was not because he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwas disinterested. In his letters Avink continually reported the prices of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}navailable land and lamented their constant increase. He simply could not\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"44\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I15.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nafford to provide for his sons. It appears that one of his sons did become a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfarmer, but for the most part his children found work in the city. Avink\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nseemed pleased to report their success as factory workers.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWhen his friend in Bargem asked about the prospects for immigrants\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin Blendon, Avink advised him to consider South Dakota. Blendon was\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nalready overcrowded in 1889, and the land was too expensive. A livable\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nforty-acre farm was selling for two thousand dollars and at least another five\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhundred was needed to equip it. \"Many people,\" he wrote, \"were moving to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nSouth Dakota where there was an abundance of good land and few people.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBut most importantly, the land there \"cost almost nothing.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIt would be fair to say that Avink was marginally successful. He was\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nable to spend his own days engaged in his chosen work, and at least one of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhis sons followed his example. The objectives of his other children are\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nunknown. Perhaps they preferred living in the city. Whatever their\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npreferences, these children were able to find work close to the family\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhomestead. They selected mates of their own nationality and remained loyal\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto the churches of the extended ethnic community. Many of the Avink\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndescendants chose this comfortable pattern: today at least fourteen families\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbearing that name continue to live in the Grand Rapids metropolitan area.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIt should be emphasized that the Avinks were not exceptional in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmigrating to urban communities. The Dutch-Americans had never confined\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntheir residences to Van Raalte\\textbackslash{}'s colony and its rural satellites. Poverty and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe early struggles for survival forced the immigrants to scatter, and the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"45\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I16.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyoung people frequently worked in neighboring \"American\" towns and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncities. Others joined Michigan\\textbackslash{}'s lumberjacks in their winter camps or hired\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nout to \"Yankee\" farmers. Before long these immigrant laborers formed urban\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nclusters in Kalamazoo, Grand Haven, Muskegon, and Grand Rapids.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe initial lure in all those cities was economic; and when urban\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmigrants prospered, they encouraged both their rural acquaintances and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntheir friends in the Netherlands to join them. Furthermore, the opportunity\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto acquire inexpensive agricultural land in the colony decreased during the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nseventies and eighties. Consequently, both newly arrived immigrants and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe children of the initial settlers were motivated to seek livelihoods outside\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the colony. Klass Ridder described these altered circumstances in letters\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto his family in Staphorst: \"Presently there is no demand for farmhands here\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n{[}in Drenthe, Michigan{]}.\" He declared, \"There are too many farmhands\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhere, and they can hardly find places to work. The farmers have too much\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmachinery, and the hired hands can no longer earn one dollar per\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nday.... Land is increasingly more expensive, and many Dutch people are\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ngoing West to the Dakotas and Iowa, where much more land is available at\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlower prices than here in the colony.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</part>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</div3>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<part id=\"S9831-D025\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<head>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<b>The Lure of Urban Life</b>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</head>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nStructured by its factories, skilled trades, and businesses, urban life\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconditioned the immigrant\\textbackslash{}'s behavior and perspective.

During the period of rapid industrialization that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfollowed the Civil War, these ethnic enclaves grew steadily.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe experience of Henry Kroes in Muskegon illustrates the precarious\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}neconomic situation which confronted factory workers during the 1890s:\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nFrom Ferwerd, Friesland, where diminished economic activity in 1891\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nprovided Kroes with only intermittent employment, he and his wife, Altje\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBouma, immigrated to Muskegon, Michigan. Altje\\textbackslash{}'s parents had preceded\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntheir daughter and son-in-law to that region during a more flourishing era,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand the Boumas\\textbackslash{}' letters had primed Kores to expect \"plenty to eat, plenty of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmoney, and plenty of work for everyone.\" But Kroes arrived just as the high\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntide of Muskegon\\textbackslash{}'s lumber era had begun to ebb, and many of its sawmills\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwere idle.

In a very\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nquiet, undisturbed tone, he assured us that everything would be all\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nright if we only had a little patience. But, of course, this good advice\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndidn\\textbackslash{}'t help us much. After about three more weeks of walking from\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nplace to place and asking as best we could for work, we were\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfortunate in securing a job at the Rolling Mill in Lakeside. A new\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbuilding was to be erected, and we had to shovel the loose sand away\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nso the foundation of the building could be put on hard sand.</i>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<i>During the first year we spent in America, Muskegon Heights\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncame into being, and as I passed a small planing mill located there at\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthat time, a man came out of the mill and asked me if I wanted to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwork. As I was out looking for work, this appealed to me, and I was\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnever particular as to what kind of work I was expected to do. I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nworked at whatever I was told to do, as long as I was paid for doing\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nit, because we were really in need of some money. Like all my other\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}njobs, this one turned out to be a hard one. This mill was moving to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntheir new location in Muskegon Heights, and it was my job to load\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe wagons with heavy sacks of cement, logs, machinery, and so on. I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nworked for four days, ten hours per day, and when everything was\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmoved and the work was all done, I received four dollars.

While\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npassing the lumberyard I stopped to ask for work, and was hired to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwork piling lumber. This was the best job I had had up until then, but\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nafter a few days there, a man came up from the mill who needed a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nman to help there.

Also I had to watch out continually for the slabs that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwere coming down the chute, so as not to get hit on the head or\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nshoulders. But even by watching, it was impossible to avoid being hit.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nLumber was cheap in those days, and much of it was burned or\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwasted.

I was telling another employee whom I was walking with about\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmy experience that day, and he told me not to work so hard. He said\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto let the hole get full so that they cannot chute any more slabs into it\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand they\\textbackslash{}'ll give me some help. This sounded like good advice. He also\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntold me that if the boss came and told me to hurry up, I should say,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"I\\textbackslash{}'m doing the best I can.\" I said this sentence over and over to be\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsure I\\textbackslash{}'d remember it. The next morning I went to work in the slab\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhole but worked much slower, and it wasn\\textbackslash{}'t long before the chute was\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nblocked. Soon the boss came swearing and cursing, but I merely said\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhat I had learned the previous evening. \"I do the best I can,\" and it\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwasn\\textbackslash{}'t very long before another man came to help me; and this was\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmuch better.</i>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<i>During this summer our first baby was born.

He had to go on to North Holland,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbut told me if I went with him I could visit with Rev\\&dot; K\\&dot; Kuiper who\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhad been our pastor for seven years in Ferwerd. He had recently\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmoved to Grand Haven, having been called by the First Christian\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nReformed Church there.

In\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfact, my brother and I always addressed him as Father Kuiper, and I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhad a great longing to see him again. So, I decided to make the trip to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nGrand Haven. However, not having any money to spend for train\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfare, we had to walk. Upon arriving in Grand Haven at the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nminister\\textbackslash{}'s home, we were heartily welcomed, and I soon felt that he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwould like to have us stay in Grand Haven. The following day the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nminister and I started out looking for work. We called at the corn\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nplanter factory and one or two other places, but without much\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsuccess. However, the Reverend persuaded me to stay over for the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnight, saying we would try again in the morning.

He took me to the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntannery and asked a Mr\\&dot; Nyland, who was then the owner, for work\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor me.

I finally found an old\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nabandoned house on Pennoyer Ave. It was hardly liveable, having no\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndoors and broken windows. But the rent was cheap, so we moved in.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI found a man in Grand Haven who had a team of horses and a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsleigh. He offered to move our furniture from Muskegon. I was to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhelp him, so we started in the morning and arrived in Muskegon\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}naround noon. We loaded what little furniture we had accumulated\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nduring our stay in Muskegon and started back for Grand Haven.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThis was in the month of February, and it was cold and dark when\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwe finally got back to Grand Haven. Mother and the baby arrived the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnext day by train. We didn\\textbackslash{}'t live in this house long before we were\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}noffered a much better house, whose owner, an old man, lived\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nupstairs. This was old man Joldersma. Here, too, our living quarters\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwere very unpleasant.</i>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<i>While living here, we had a peculiar experience, and we could\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsee the hand of God leading us along. While working one day, I cut\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmy hand, and it developed into a severe case of blood poisoning. We\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhad a grocer who called regularly for the grocery order, but when he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnoticed that I was not working, he was afraid we wouldn\\textbackslash{}'t be able to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npay for the groceries we ordered and refused to come. Being perfect\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nstrangers with no money, we didn\\textbackslash{}'t know what to do; but God, who\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsees all things, knew our circumstances, and he laid upon our friend\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDykstra\\textbackslash{}'s heart to undertake for us once more without any effort on\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nour part. He went around and found another grocer who agreed to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfurnish us with our daily needs. The grocer\\textbackslash{}'s name was Teese, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsoon after this I returned to work.</i>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<i>The longer we were in Grand Haven, the more acquaintances\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwe acquired, and among these was an old man, Pete Van Druinen,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwho told us he had a house for rent on Pennoyer Ave\\&dot;, close to where\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwe had formerly lived. We moved in here, and this was by far the best\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhouse we had lived in since coming to Grand Haven. This was in the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nspring of 1893, and the house cost us \\$3 per month.</i>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<i>I only worked {[}until 1896{]} at the tannery, and then this factory\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwent bankrupt.

This work was entirely\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnew to me and so different from what I had been accustomed to, that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nI found the days extremely long and tiresome. To make matters\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nworse, I contracted rheumatism in my left leg. My job required that I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nstand up at the buffing wheel, and this I could hardly do without</i>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"51\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<i>suffering tremendous pain. Every day I hoped the pain would leave on\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe morrow, and again and again I would go to the doctor, hardly\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbeing able to walk home after one of his treatments. At the Brass\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nFoundry, we had only piece work, and I had to work hard to make\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\$1.25 per day. These were the darkest days during our stay in Grand\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHaven.</i>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<i>About this time the tannery was sold to a new owner, and he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nstarted operating it again. As soon as I heard about this I applied for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmy former job and it was given to me again. So now I was once more\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfishing wet and slimy bark and hides out of the large vats. We wore\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nrubber boots to keep our legs and feet dry, but these boots wore out,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand there was never any money left over to buy new boots, so that I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nalways had wet feet and legs. Soon I was bothered with rheumatism\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nagain, and on the advice of the doctor we decided to quit the tannery\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand move back to Muskegon. This was in the summer of 1901. A\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnew problem arose.

That Kroes did not migrate to Grand Rapids for work probably\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nstemmed from his immediate family attachments and his loyalty to the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nchurch which had come to his aid.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nTogether, then, the local congregation and familial ties bound Kroes\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto a region in which his economic prospects were unsure. Several of his\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nacquaintances (Steensma, Fennema, and Broersma) did migrate to Grand\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nRapids, a city that provided a wider range of economic opportunity than\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMuskegon and Grand Haven. The \"Furniture City\" also contained west\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMichigan\\textbackslash{}'s largest concentration of Dutch-Americans, together with a full\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nspectrum of their social conventions and institutions such as churches,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nschools, and small businesses.

An immigrant named J\\&dot; Verweg had\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"55\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncome to Holland, Michigan, bearing a letter of recommendation from\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAbraham Kuyper. Van Raalte wrote Kuyper, \"I\\textbackslash{}'m sorry if I have\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndisappointed you, but your recommendations do little good here, and my\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbroad recommendations are equally useless. Strenuous exertion is the only\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthing that counts here.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nVerweg, it seems, had hoped to find work in an office and expected\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwell-paid responsibilities, but he was disappointed. Van Raalte painted\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nanother picture of the opportunities in Grand Rapids, \"where,\" he wrote,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"many Hollanders live in a fast-growing factory town. They use hand\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlaborers in the factory for making furniture, doors, and windows....

Their reports provided sufficient\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nincentive to attract the common folk. Agnes Nestor described the coming\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof these new immigrants in her memoirs from the 1880s. \"We liked living\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnear the railroad depot,\" she wrote. \"We could see the trains arriving, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhen there was a trainload of Dutch immigrants coming in, we would hurry\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndown to the depot.

They came to work in the Grand Rapids\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfurniture factories, and they brought along their families.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nNestor correctly recognized that the Dutch tended to immigrate in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfamily groups. But large numbers of unmarried immigrants also settled in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwest Michigan. While family members could encourage each other in the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nface of loneliness and insecurity, single folk were more susceptible to social\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nisolation and homesickness. Though their economic burdens were relatively\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlight, they frequently missed the supporting concern of their parents and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsiblings. Some, like Jan Hofman, boarded with friends or in the homes of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmigrant families where they could recapture some aspects of family life.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nNonetheless, intimate family connections could only be maintained with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncorrespondence.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</part>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</div3>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<part id=\"S9831-D031\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nPleading with his brother, \"I hope you will write back directly.

Sheboygan County was\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nalready beginning to fill up.

Many were\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwilling to reestablish themselves when prospects seemed more attractive\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nelsewhere, but they seldom set up housekeeping beyond the reach of other\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDutch-Americans and their churches. Roelof Brinks, who had immigrated\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom Emmen in 1853, moved to Orange City, Iowa, after working and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfarming in Michigan for twenty-six years. In 1879 Brinks reported that he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhad moved to Orange City because the land in Michigan was too expensive\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor his children.

Dutch immigrants joined their new\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncountrymen in a headlong rush for land whenever new regions\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbecame available. And as more immigrants flooded into the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncountry, looking for fertile soil, the United States government, both by war\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand treaty, pushed the native Americans into undesirable areas.

Fuel was scarce;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmany immigrants resorted to burning woven bundles of prairie grass or\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimported coal. Also, the weather was unpredictable: wind storms, carrying\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsnow or dust, brought extensive hardship and damage. And prairie fires,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfanned by strong winds, caused frequent anxiety and occasional disaster.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDespite these difficulties, Netherlanders emigrated to the West\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nregularly between 1847 and 1920.

Agriculture fosters relatively sparse\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npatterns of population, especially when each farmer cultivates parcels\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"82\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}naveraging 160 acres or more. Thus, Dutch villages like Pella and Orange\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nCity in Iowa never became thickly populated commercial centers. Trade\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nroutes passed through these towns on the way to Chicago and St\\&dot; Louis, but\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe farmer\\textbackslash{}'s convenience restricted the growth of the country village. To\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsucceed, the banks, mills, and churches of these places had to be located\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwithin convenient reach. Farmers located up to twelve miles from town\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncould make a round trip to the mill or blacksmith in one day with a horse\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand wagon. When settlers located beyond the twelve-mile range, towns\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith churches and other institutions sprang up within the newly occupied\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nregions.

Scholte and his followers selected that site for several reasons. First,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand most important, they were convinced of its agricultural potential. But\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthey were also influenced by its location: the town was built on a road\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nleading to markets in Keukuk.

They soon discovered that the distance\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbetween Pella and the markets of Keukuk \\&mdash; approximately 120 miles \\&mdash; was\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntoo far to make business there a realistic option. Also, attempts to improve\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand use the Des Moines River never succeeded.

Settlers in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}neach location sought information with which to compare the relative\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsuccess of the two settlements. Thus, in 1849 H\\&dot; Van Eijk from Holland,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMichigan, urged his friend H\\&dot; Van Asselt to \"write about Rev\\&dot; H\\&dot; P\\&dot; Scholte\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand his colony.\" For Van Eijk said, \"They do not speak well of it here.

Within one year he moved\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto Orange City, Iowa, where he rented a fifteen-acre farm for fifteen dollars\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nper month. But after a short time he found a larger farm of one hundred\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsixty acres. After consulting with several members of his family and the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDominie, he purchased the farm and continued to cultivate it for eleven\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyears. Due to the rising value of Orange City land, Brouwer sold his farm at\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"89\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I33.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"map\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}na handsome profit in 1899.

Albert Kuipers, who immigrated\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto South Dakota in 1882, vigorously publicized the opportunities in that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nregion.

The <i>Nieuw Advertentieblad</i> in Friesland published Kuipers\\textbackslash{}'s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}naccount of Roelof Bartelds\\textbackslash{}'s experience of 1888. Bartelds was the poorest\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmigrant to accompany Kuipers to South Dakota. \"He was a poor peat\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndigger from Zuidwolde (Drenthe),\" who with his two children had to work a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfull year to pay for their passage to America.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</part>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</div3>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<part id=\"S9831-D059\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAfter working to pay off these debts, Bartelds, with Kuipers\\textbackslash{}'s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nassistance, found a piece of open land.

The private reports of one brother\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto another probably carried far more authority. Ulbe Eringa, who\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmigrated from Veldwijk in 1892, corresponded regularly with his family\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nover twenty-five years, and such letters, passed from hand to hand, spread\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndetailed and reliable reports among Eringa\\textbackslash{}'s family and friends.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDuring the summer of 1892, Eringa arrived in Hull, Iowa, where by\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nprior arrangement he lived with a friend named Abma. Within a few days\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nafter his arrival, \"A woman came riding up into the yard with two nice\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhorses and a wagon.\" This woman, Mrs\\&dot; Hunt, had heard that a new Dutch\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfarmhand had arrived, and her husband needed help. Ulbe moved in with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthis English family and wrote, \"They are real Americans and they speak\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nEnglish, but it is very neat here and the people are very friendly.\" He\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbelieved that they were Christian people because they \"have five Bibles,\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbut, he continued, \"they don\\textbackslash{}'t read them; that is not the custom here. Also\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthey don\\textbackslash{}'t pray after meals. Mr\\&dot; Hunt does say a small prayer before eating,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbut I don\\textbackslash{}'t understand him.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWithin a short time Eringa discovered a number of old acquaintances\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand friends in the neighborhood. In Orange City he met Johannes v\\&dot; d\\&dot;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nSchaaf, who had been a hired hand for Ulbe\\textbackslash{}'s uncle in Friesland. Then, \"to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmy surprise,\" he wrote, \"Hedser Reipstra lives a half hour off from me. He is\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nan old friend of mine.... He lives with a big farmer and even owns an\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAmerican carriage. He may use the farmer\\textbackslash{}'s horses for nothing, and I have\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nridden with him three times already when he has taken me to church.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWell satisfied with his new life, Eringa said, \"I am very much at home here,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand I can hardly imagine that I am in America.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe activities of the Dutch church constantly attracted Ulbe, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nover the years he supported its growth with time and money. In 1892 he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nattended a church in nearby Sioux Center and wrote, \"I almost forgot that I\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwas in America.\" In the same letter he said, \"All those things make me\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmore enthused about going to church here than in Veldwijk.\" It is not\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndifficult to understand this reaction. The church was the social center of the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDutch-American community. Friends from all over the region gathered\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthere each Sunday, and after laboring among strangers, the Sunday services\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nprovided a perfect opportunity to forget being in America. The church was\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nalso an especially crucial institution for young men seeking a compatible\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nspouse.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMaatje Riepstra, who became Ulbe\\textbackslash{}'s wife, immigrated to Iowa in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n1893. Although they may have known each other in the Netherlands, their\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"92\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I35.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncourtship in Hull, Iowa, was facilitated by meeting each Sunday for worship\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand instruction. Working long hours six days each week allowed little time\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor social activity. Thus, the church, whose explicit goals were religious,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbecame the social center of the community. Here young people found mates\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhile families visited and discussed the events of the previous week.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBy 1894, just two years after immigrating, Eringa was able to report\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nprogress in achieving the most crucial goals of his life. He had found \"a fine\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwife,\" and they were living on a 220-acre farm in Running Water, South\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDakota. He had rented the land on shares which allowed him to keep two\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthirds of the harvest for his own livelihood. In the process he was acquiring\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlivestock and equipment which he used later on his own farm. His church\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhad elected him as an elder, and he was asked to read sermons in the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nabsence of a regular minister. \"It is good here,\" he declared.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThese concerns \\&mdash; farm, family, and church \\&mdash; constituted the abiding\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsubstance of Ulbe\\textbackslash{}'s life. As a farmer he progressed steadily, acquiring his\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nown 160-acre farm in 1899. By 1904 he had accumulated 320 acres and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nspoke hopefully of paying off the balance of his mortgage. In 1918 he was\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nalready looking forward to retirement and to the prospect of his son\\textbackslash{}'s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"93\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninheriting the farm. During most of these years Ulbe was not land-poor,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbecause he sold cattle and hogs for cash in Chicago. On several occasions\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe visited the huge Chicago slaughterhouses and traveled from there to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nGrand Rapids, Michigan, where he discovered old friends whom he had not\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nseen for twenty-five years. In 1910 he visited the Netherlands with his oldest\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndaughter to strengthen the familial ties which his frequent correspondence\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhad preserved. Two of his daughters became teachers, while a third, living\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnearby, married Johannes v\\&dot; d\\&dot; Wei, a farmer and \"a good man.\" Ulbe\\textbackslash{}'s only\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nson, Pier, seemed well inclined to life on the farm, and Ulbe expected to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nleave him a goodly inheritance.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBy participating constantly in the life of his church, Ulbe expanded\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhis cultural horizons. As a leading elder, he read sermons to the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncongregation during the frequent absence of an ordained minister, and on\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntwo occasions he attended synodical meetings in New York, where he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"heard sermons from the best ministers and missionaries of the Holland\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nReformed Church.\" These occasions, together with his business trips to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nChicago, exposed Eringa to a large part of America. Eighteen years after his\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I36.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"94\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmigration, Ulbe had become a solid citizen of South Dakota and the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDutch-American community.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nRunning Water, Eringa\\textbackslash{}'s home, was but one of a dozen Dutch\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncommunities in the southeastern part of South Dakota. Concentrated\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nprimarily in Charles Mix and Douglas Counties, these settlements never\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nprospered as those in Iowa did. Drought forced many immigrants to sell or\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nleave their homesteads and resettle elsewhere. Towns like Nieveen,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nFriesland, and Running Water were all abandoned. That phenomenon, of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncourse, was not peculiar to South Dakota. Even in fertile Iowa more than\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntwo thousand towns and villages were abandoned during the first hundred\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyears of the state\\textbackslash{}'s existence. Villages without rail connections had little\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nchance of survival, and many towns were organized by promoters who\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nadvertised the virtues of their new sites only to sell land. Frequently\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nrailroads founded towns on their own property and then assured the success\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof their investments by restricting access to rail transportation within the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncompany\\textbackslash{}'s town, while causing nearby towns to decline.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWhen the big influx of Dutch settlers entered South Dakota in the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nearly 1880s, immigrants from several other European countries joined them.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nEach national group tended to establish its own villages, while Americans,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmixing freely among most of the immigrants, usually controlled the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I37.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"95\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncounties\\textbackslash{}' governmental structure. In Douglas County the Ukrainians,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nGermans, and Dutch clustered in separate national groups, while in Charles\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMix County, Dutch villages stood near others with Swedish and Norwegian\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninhabitants. Ethnic cohesion of this sort was a common feature on the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAmerican landscape. Ulbe Eringa noted in 1903 that he had rented a 160-acre\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfarm from a Norwegian. \"This family,\" he wrote, \"acquired the farm 30\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyears ago for nothing (under the Homestead Law), and now they can sell it\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor \\$40 per acre. This sixty-year-old couple is moving to a Norwegian city in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMinnesota.\" Ulbe concluded, \"That is the way things are here in America.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<head>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<b>From Wisconsin to Nebraska</b>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</head>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe first Dutch immigrants to cultivate the flat Nebraska plains came\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom Wisconsin.

After reading the pamphlet, C\\&dot; A\\&dot; Sluys and his wife\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nagreed that they would like to join the emigrant society, but not without\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntheir father\\textbackslash{}'s consent. They asked him to read the pamphlet, with the prior\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nunderstanding that they would use his reaction as a sign. If he counseled\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nagainst emigration, they would remain in the Netherlands. After reading\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe advertisement, the old man said, \"Even if this is only half true, I still\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbelieve that it would be better to join that venture than to remain here.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe credibility of the Colorado venture was further enhanced by the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsupport it received from a respected theology professor, M\\&dot; Noordzij, from\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nKampen. Thus the die was cast, and the C\\&dot; A\\&dot; Sluys family joined a group\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof 211 emigrants sailing toward Colorado.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nUpon their arrival the settlers were housed in two barracks, each\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncontaining a hundred people. C\\&dot; A\\&dot; Sluys reported that the high altitude,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n8,000 feet above sea level, was too radical a change for people who had\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbeen raised in the lowlands, and that at night the winter temperatures\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndropped far below zero. Then, in these compressed living conditions, scarlet\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfever broke out among the children, causing eleven of them to die. \"Our\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nyoungest darling,\" Sluys wrote, \"a girl of eight months, was the last of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthese.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe pamphlet which attracted these folk to Colorado proved to be a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncomplete fabrication. Its author had never visited the site. If he had, he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwould have recognized that the area\\textbackslash{}'s dry soil was totally useless. The\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndisappointed immigrants telegraphed Professor Noordzij and he responded,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"I\\textbackslash{}'m coming immediately.\" Before he arrived, the colony split up, but a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnumber remained together, awaiting the professor\\textbackslash{}'s assistance. When he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nappeared, it was agreed that they should find better land at a lower altitude.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nSome, then settled on government land near the Nebraska border.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"101\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMeanwhile, C\\&dot; A\\&dot; Sluys felt obliged to report their troublesome\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nexperiences to the newspaper in Enkhuizen. When news of this sabotage\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nreached the immigration society\\textbackslash{}'s agent in Colorado, Sluys was thrown out\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof the colony. Hearing this, Sluys\\textbackslash{}'s wife, whom he described as \"not easily\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndiscouraged,\" broke down. \"Now what must we do,\" she wailed, \"8000 miles\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom our family, in a land where we can hardly speak the language and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthrown out of the colony with neither money nor food in sight, and then\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwithout a house in two days?\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nSluys sought advice from an English neighbor for whom his fourteen-year-old\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndaughter had been working. Following his neighbor\\textbackslash{}'s advice, Sluys\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfound work with a railroad construction crew sixteen miles away. Soon\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthereafter part of the colony disbanded. Most of them received assistance\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom Dutch churches in Iowa and relocated in the older colonies. A few,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlike Sluys, drifted from one place to another.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWorking by turns on railroad construction and as a farmer, Sluys\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nremained in Colorado for about ten years. His farming efforts were hindered\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nby conflicts over water rights (irrigation was necessary in Colorado) and by\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndistant markets. Without railroad connections his crops had to be sold\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlocally, and the sparse Colorado population produced slight demand. On\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}none occasion prices were so low that the local farmers burned their grain for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfuel.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nFor a time Sluys worked as a gardener in Sterling, Colorado, while his\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwife operated a restaurant in their home. Finally, exasperated by the dry and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncapricious climate, Sluys decided \"to move northward or toward the Pacific\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nCoast.\" For one year he labored in Nebraska, saving money to finance his\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}none-thousand-mile trek to Montana. After reaching Great Falls, Montana,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhe ran out of money and again found employment with a railroad\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconstruction gang. He became a shift boss and was forced to move westward\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith the progress of the railroad\\textbackslash{}'s construction, but he gained free housing\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nat each new location.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThen, in 1908, he returned to farming on government land near\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nConrad, Montana, where he acquired 560 acres: Unable to locate water for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nirrigation, he sold part of this land and moved to another location in the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nConrad area. There he was quite successful.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBy 1923 part of his family had migrated to Lynden, Washington, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nSluys followed his children to that successful Dutch Colony. There, where\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe Pacific Ocean restricted the westward movement, Sluys returned to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ngardening and cultivated several acres to provide for himself. \"Lynden,\" he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwrote, \"is a good place; there is much land here close to the river which is\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nas fertile as the best land in Holland for agriculture.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nTo choose such a lonely trek was exceptional among the Calvinist\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDutch immigrants. On one occasion Sluys wrote that he had not seen\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nanother Dutchman in seven years. He did, however, communicate regularly\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith his family in Enkhuizen, and he was happy to discover Dutch churches\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin Conrad, Montana, and Lynden, Washington.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"102\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nLynden and its neighboring Dutch settlements were among the last to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbe founded by Dutch-Americans. Like Orange City, Firth, and Running\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWater, they were established to satisfy a constant demand for inexpensive\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nland. The founding of the Washington settlements occurred in the late\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n1890s, during the last days of the general American frontier. Thus, while\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nopen land existed, the Dutch joined other Americans in their pursuit of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nagricultural opportunities. The most successful Dutch colonies on the West\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nCoast were established by immigrants with previous experience in older\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncolonies where land had become scarce or expensive.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<head>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<b>The Pacific Coast</b>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</head>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nOak Harbor, Washington, was the Dutch-Americans\\textbackslash{}' first colony on\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe Pacific Coast. Reports of that area\\textbackslash{}'s fertility reached the older Dutch\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsettlements after 1894, and soon settlers were arriving from western\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMichigan, Chicago, and South Dakota. They acquired farms of forty or\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}neighty acres, still encumbered with stumps left by lumber companies. After\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nclearing the land, the settlers immediately established a church.

Heller had struggled with a ten-acre farm in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMichigan, supplementing that narrow living as a day laborer. In Oak\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHarbor he reported earning twice as much as he had in Michigan. He\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nacquired land and expected to build a new house there. Meanwhile, he\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nrented a house in the village of Oak Harbor. The fishing fleets that docked\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnearby often provided him and his neighbors with free fish.

The economic potential\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin California was especially obvious, but despite several organized efforts to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlure Dutch settlers there, no successful colony grew in California until after\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe turn of the century.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBy 1910 a small community of Dutch-Americans had settled in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nRedlands, California, where they organized a Dutch church.

Some of these distinctions had origins\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin the various Dutch provinces from which the immigrants came, but the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmost powerful divisions grew within the American setting. The potential for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndenominational unity fractured on the rock of Americanization.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDutch-Americans drew the issues of their debates from their\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}necclesiastical experience in the Netherlands, trying, as much as possible, to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmaintain those practices that they carried with them to the New World.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nEach church group defended its views by appealing to confessional\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nstatements and practices originating in the Netherlands; innovations were\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsuspect.

Almost without\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nexception the immigrants sought and joined those churches that seemed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmost like the churches they had left behind.

Van Raalte led most of the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwest Michigan colony into a union with the Reformed Protestant Dutch\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nChurch which had originated in New Amsterdam during the seventeenth\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncentury. But two congregations in the Michigan colony had difficulties with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nVan Raalte\\textbackslash{}'s leadership and joined the Presbyterian denomination. In 1857\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nanother segment rejected Van Raalte\\textbackslash{}'s decision to affiliate with the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nReformed Protestant Dutch Church and organized a new denomination, the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWare Hollandsch Gereformeerde Kerk.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nSimilar divisions developed in Wisconsin.

Van Raalte\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"114\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nspearheaded a movement to form an ecclesiastical bond with the Reformed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nProtestant Dutch Church, known today as the Reformed Church in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAmerica. Most of the early immigrants followed Van Raalte\\textbackslash{}'s leadership and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}njoined this church group. Originating in the seventeenth century, this\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndenomination was quite Americanized. They had adopted the English\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlanguage in worship and supported some of the revival techniques prevalent\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}namong the evangelical churches of America. Further, since revivals were\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nessentially interdenominational efforts, the Reformed Church in America\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nassociated more readily with other church groups and developed a somewhat\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}necumenical posture. These developments provided a comfortable situation\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfor not only the more pietistic early immigrants but also later immigrants,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwho preferred a more rapid pace of Americanization.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nImmigrants adhering more tenaciously to the ecclesiastical patterns of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe Netherlands tended to join the <i>Ware Hollandsch Gereformeerde Kerk,</i>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nknown today as the Christian Reformed Church. This denomination\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncontinued using the Dutch language in worship well into the 1930s. It has\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmaintained official connections with the <i>Gereformeerde Kerken</i> in the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nNetherlands from 1882 to the present, and it has opposed adopting the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nrevival techniques which the immigrants frequently identified with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMethodism.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMany of the immigrants who were part of the second great stream of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmigration from the Netherlands, 1880-1920, joined the Christian\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nReformed Church. The familiar language, pattern of worship, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconnection with the <i>Gereformeerde Kerk</i> in the Netherlands combined to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmake this choice attractive. Moreover, the already-established immigrants of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe earlier period dominated the western segment of the Reformed Church\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin America. So immigrants of the late-nineteenth century were able to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninfluence the character of the Christian Reformed Church more readily\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthan they could influence the larger and well-established Reformed Church.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAlso, as one might expect, social tensions developed between the older and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnewer immigrants, and the newer immigrants maintained their identity by\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}njoining the Christian Reformed Church. During the decade of heaviest\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmigration from the Netherlands (53,000 between 1880-1890), the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmembership of the Christian Reformed Church grew from twelve thousand\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto fifty-three thousand.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIn any case, during the whole period of immigration, new arrivals had\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto choose which denomination they would join. Whatever their choice, the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmigrants used the churches to preserve their religious convictions and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninstruct their children along traditional lines. Thus the church and its\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nminister became the crucial core of the Dutch-American community.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<head>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<b>Church Talk</b>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</head>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe details of church life \\&mdash; the coming and going of ministers,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nelection to church offices, and the building or enlargement of sanctuaries \\&mdash;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nappeared constantly in the immigrants\\textbackslash{}' correspondence. Perhaps some of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"115\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthis \"church talk\" followed a desire to convince relatives in the Netherlands\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthat immigration had not weakened the faith.

Founded in 1876, Calvin Theological\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nSeminary came quickly under Abraham Kuyper\\textbackslash{}'s influence. Throughout the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnineteenth century the school drew its instructors from the Netherlands.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe first four professors were trained at Kampen and emphasized the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndoctrinal concerns of the <i>Afscheiding.</i> But Geerhardus Vos, who came to the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nschool in 1890, carried fresh ideas to Grand Rapids. He had developed\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nstrong attachments to Abraham Kuyper while studying in the Netherlands,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand became Kuyper\\textbackslash{}'s American spokesman. The introduction of Kuyperian\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nprinciples caused considerable controversy in the seminary and church. The\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nolder ministers, L\\&dot; J\\&dot; Hulst, G\\&dot; Boer, W\\&dot; Hemkes, and F\\&dot; Ten Hoor, resisted\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthis new infusion of Dutch theology.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</part>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</div3>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<part id=\"S9831-D080\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<head>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<b>Abraham Kuyper: Influence from Abroad</b>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</head>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nRev\\&dot; J\\&dot; Vander Mey, who studied under Geerhardus Vos, wrote a letter\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto Abraham Kuyper in 1896, paying tribute to his intellectual father:\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<bl>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<i>Almost all the ministers of our church who were educated in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAmerica embrace your principles.

Although G\\&dot; Vos left Grand Rapids to join the theological\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nseminary of Princeton in New Jersey, many students followed him to receive\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npost-graduate instruction. Many others traveled to the Netherlands and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nattended the Free University of Amsterdam. Between 1902 and 1948 twelve\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninstructors were appointed to the faculty of Calvin Seminary; and all but\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}none of these attended the Free University or Princeton, where Geerhardus\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nVos continued teaching until 1932. Thus Abraham Kuyper did not lack\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndisciples in the New World.

He maintained\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconnections with G\\&dot; Vos in Grand Rapids and corresponded frequently with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAbraham Kuyper. Both Steffens and Vos had difficulty persuading their\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncolleagues to adopt Kuyperian views.

Vander Mey expressed the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnature of that dilemma with exceptional clarity. Writing to A\\&dot; Kuyper in\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n1896, Vander Mey complained:\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<bl>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<i>As Reformed Christians we face a dark future here in America.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nPeople in the Netherlands have no idea how the whole of America\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndrinks from the fountains of Methodism, and the young people in our\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nchurch also lean in that direction. We scarcely know how to preserve\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthem. If, as many prefer, we choose to remain isolated as Hollanders,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwe will be signing our own death warrants. But the other option \\&mdash;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nswift Americanization \\&mdash; often results in more disastrous\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconsequences.</i>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</bl>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDutch Americans have found no single answer to Vander Mey\\textbackslash{}'s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndilemma, but with varying success they have attempted to retain what they\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconsider best in their ethnic tradition. Among those whose Netherlandic\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nroots are most directly connected with the <i>Afscheiding</i> of the 1830s,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAmericanization is more complete. For these Dutch-Americans the church\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconstitutes the most direct link with an ethnic past. But, as we have seen,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"125\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe <i>Afscheiding</i> was a simpler and more narrow interpretation of Christian\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlife than was the <i>Doleantie.</i> Thus the <i>Afscheiding,</i> with its concern for piety\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand pure doctrine, could more readily adapt to American society. The\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<i>Afgescheidenen</i> were also among the earliest immigrants, and their\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndescendants have had more time to adjust their views to the American\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncontext.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDutch immigrants attached to the <i>Doleantie</i> have approached the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nproblem of Americanization more aggressively than those who arrived\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbefore the 1880s. Although willing to join American society, many of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAbraham Kuyper\\textbackslash{}'s followers hoped to influence the institutions of North\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAmerica by establishing separate schools, labor unions, political parties,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand newspapers. They believed that Christians outside of the Dutch-American\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncommunity could be attracted to these institutions. But, aside\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom the Christian school, these efforts have enjoyed small success.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe Christian school, however, has continued to grow, supported by\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nboth a Holland and a general American constituency. Christian Schools\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nInternational, an organization that encompasses more than three hundred\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nschools and more than sixty thousand students, has attempted to preserve\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npart of the Kuyperian view in American society. Staffed primarily by\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ngraduates of Dutch-American colleges, the Christian schools attempt to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlead successive generations along paths that originate from both the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<i>Afscheiding</i> and the <i>Doleantie.</i>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThis dual tradition has been the source of some tension in the Dutch-American\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncommunity. The western congregations of the Reformed Church\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin America, those that originated in Van Raalte\\textbackslash{}'s era, have emphasized\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npersonal piety and doctrinal purity more than the eastern segment of the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I52.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"126\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndenomination; while the doctrinal-pietistic traditions of the Christian\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nReformed Church have blunted the influence of Abraham Kuyper\\textbackslash{}'s\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDoleantie. Additional complications have arisen from the American\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncontext in which those churches have developed. Nonetheless, both\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndenominations continue to bear the clear imprint of their Netherlandic\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}norigins.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</part>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</div3>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<part id=\"S9831-D082\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<head>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<b>The Road Ahead</b>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</head>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nFor rather obvious reasons nineteenth-century Holland-American\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmigrants have experienced relatively few difficulties in their adopted land.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nFirst, they were northern Europeans whose appearance and general values\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndiffered little from the dominant Anglo-American cultural establishment.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nEven more significantly, Netherlanders had been present in North America\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsince the early seventeenth century, and their descendants made the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnewcomers less conspicuous. These new immigrants also benefited from the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ntradition of acceptability and the achievements established by their\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nseventeenth-century forerunners. Further, because their names were easily\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconfused with those of the original Dutch families, they acquired some of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe prestige which the older families enjoyed as founders and original\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsettlers.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIn the United States only the English enjoyed similarly prestigious\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}norigins. The Spanish and French were less acceptable because of their\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nCatholicism, and all other large groups of Europeans arrived after the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAnglo-American patterns had been established. By contrast, Netherlanders\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhad preceded many English colonists, and the Dutch created their own\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncultural hegemony in New Amsterdam. Even after the English captured the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDutch colony in 1664, immigrants arriving in that area frequently\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconformed to the Netherlandic cultural setting. Swedes, Germans, and even\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsome of the English were forced to adopt the Dutch language in order to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconduct business. As late as the 1840s, when the \"new\" immigration began,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfresh arrivals easily encountered Dutch-speaking guides and advisers in New\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nYork and New Jersey.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAlong with all these advantages Holland-Americans constituted so\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsmall a minority in North America that they never threatened an already-established\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncultural pattern. By contrast, the Irish entered Boston in such\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlarge numbers that they threatened and eventually captured political power\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom the old Anglo-American elite. Nineteenth-century Holland-Americans\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndid dominate whole regions of Michigan, Iowa, and elsewhere,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbut they generally acquired open or sparsely populated districts, thus\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nreducing the potential for cultural clash and competition.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHolland-Americans have resisted total Americanization by choice and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnot because they were unwelcome in the centers of American life. In fact, it\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhas been easy for Dutch-Americans to drift into the mainstream of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAmerican culture because they have always been there. Names like De\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nVries, Roosevelt, Vander Bilt, and De Witt were common and frequently\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"127\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nprestigious when the nineteenth-century immigration began. While Poles,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nItalians, and Jews have been tempted to Anglicize their names to gain\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nacceptance in American society, Hollanders have felt little pressure in that\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndirection. Peter De Vries, a best-selling American novelist, but also the son\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nof a nineteenth-century immigrant, has utilized the confusion connected\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwith distinguishing the \"old\" Dutch families from the \"new\" to create a\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndelightful scene in his novel, <i>The Blood of the Lamb.</i> In this somewhat\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nautobiographical story, De Vries, thinly veiled as the main character,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWanderhope, crashes high American social circles in Chicago because the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"Americans\" easily confuse his name with those of the New York elite.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nWhen the Chicago socialite Mrs\\&dot; Winkler asks, \"Have you ever been\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nabroad?\" Wanderhope answers, \"No, but my parents have. They\\textbackslash{}'ve spent\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmany years in Europe.\" And, of course, before emigrating to Chicago,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhere he became a garbage collector, De Vries\\textbackslash{}'s father had indeed spent\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\"many years in Europe.\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIt is true that Dutch family names often appear in lists of prestigious\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAmericans; virtually every chronicler of Dutch-American history will cite\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe three Presidents Martin Van Buren, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nD\\&dot; Roosevelt, together with Senator Arthur Vanden Berg. And books like\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<i>Hollanders Who Helped Build America</i> (1942), by H\\&dot; M\\&dot; Viekke and H\\&dot;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBeets,<note ref=\"3\">3 <i>This book contains biographical sketches for more than five hundred living Dutch-Americans.</i></note> demonstrate that Holland-Americans have become prominent\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmembers of every profession in America. But it is difficult to determine\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwhat degree of ethnic consciousness these people have retained; the specific\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncharacter of their contributions seldom bears a direct relationship to their\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnational origin.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHolland-Americans have probably had the strongest influence on\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAmerican culture in the are of religious affairs. In the long run, for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nexample, the influence of the immigrant preacher T\\&dot; J\\&dot; Frelinghuysen has\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbeen vastly greater than that of Governor Peter Stuyvesant. As a principal\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninitiator of the religious movement known as the Great Awakening\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n(1720-1760), Frelinghuysen, who carried his pietism from the Netherlands,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nused it to influence the character of the American religious revival. The\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconsequences of that influence can be readily observed in the activity of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBilly Graham.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe impact of the nineteenth-century immigration remains less clear;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nbut because they occupy identifiable regions in Michigan, Iowa, and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nelsewhere, these Holland-Americans have preserved a sufficient level of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nethnic identity to influence the larger American community. Still, aside\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom a few isolated cases, the success of prominent individuals usually stems\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nfrom that person\\textbackslash{}'s activity as an American rather than as a Dutch-American.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBy contrast, institutions frequently preserve pure ethnic traits.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nChurches, schools, hospitals, and homes for the aged, which spring from\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand support the ethnic family and its values, are able to enlarge a small\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"128\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I53.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncommunity\\textbackslash{}'s sphere of influence more effectively than the ordinary\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nindividual can. For example, an educational institution like Calvin College\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nin Grand Rapids, Michigan, has already provided leadership among other\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nchurch-related schools who reject the views of our post-Christian world but\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nwish for more than mere survival through isolation. It is the influence of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAbraham Kuyper\\textbackslash{}'s <i>Doleantie</i> which has strengthened the capacity of Calvin\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nCollege to provide leadership in examining the cultural dimensions of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nChristianity in America.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIn recent years the growth potential for ethnic survival in the United\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nStates has increased. Although the causes of this development are not easily\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nidentified, they relate to a general lack of self-confidence in the centers of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nAmerican power and influence. Problems (the riots in the 1960s, the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nVietnam War, and political corruption) have forced many opinion leaders to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nreconsider their faith in progress, because the foundation of that faith seems\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nless secure. First, the supposedly unlimited supply of cheap raw material,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nupon which America\\textbackslash{}'s wide-spread consumer economy depends, seems to be\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndwindling. Up to this moment no technological \"miracle\" has appeared to\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nsignificantly alter the source or amount of available energy which feeds the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconsumption ethos. Also, it has become increasingly evident that the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninstitutions of democracy have not improved either the moral or intellectual\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nqualities of the populace and its leaders.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nNaive though it may seem, the American Dream has been built upon\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe twin foundations of economic and moral progress. The keystone of this\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nedifice has been the public schools, which were urged to draw all people \\&mdash;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nblack and white; Protestant, Catholic, and Jew \\&mdash; into a great melting pot.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<page n=\"129\">\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nFrom this crucible educational leaders hoped to forge a new humanity whose\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ncommon faith in the ideals and institutions of democracy would transcend\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nall ethnic and religious difference. The rewards of this new faith were socio-economic\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nadvancement, and those who believed and lived in accord with\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe \"American Way\" were promised success.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nDuring the past two centuries many European immigrants have been\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}neconomically successful. They have become landowners and homeowners,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand their children have progressed to careers in business and well-paid\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nprofessions. But the potential for continued advancement of this sort seems\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nto be clogging up. Hard work no longer leads automatically to improved\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nliving standards. Diplomas do not insure entrance into desired professions.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nMore significantly still, those who have succeeded often find the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmeaninglessness of their lives a source of discontent.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIt seems probable that the cause of this disillusionment rests upon the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nrelatively scant cultural tapestry offered in the American Dream. By\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconcentrating the core of American values in political theories born in the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}neighteenth century, by defining social status within the narrow band of\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmaterial consumption, American culture has offered too little substance for\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhuman satisfaction or fulfillment. One compensatory reaction to these\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlimited cultural currents may be an intensified adherence to ethnic values\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nand traditions \\&mdash; a phenomenon which many American scholars and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}njournalists have discussed recently.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe research of three prominent authors (D\\&dot; P\\&dot; Moynihan, J\\&dot;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHigham, and M\\&dot; Gordon<note ref=\"4\">4 <i>Daniel P\\&dot; Moynihan and Nathan Glazer,</i> Beyond The Melting Pot <i>(Cambridge, Mass\\&dot;: M\\&dot;I\\&dot;T\\&dot;\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nPress, 1963); Milton Gordon,</i> Assimilation in American Life <i>(New York: Oxford Univ\\&dot; Press,\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n1968); John Higham,</i> Send Me These <i>(New York: Athenium, 1975).</i></note>) has confirmed the suspicion that the melting\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}npot formula has not dissolved America\\textbackslash{}'s ethnic groups and that the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nimmigrants and their descendants have maintained loyalties to both their\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nEuropean and American traditions. Thus, the prospect of a continuing and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nvital ethnic awareness remains strong.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nBut more recently, in the 1980\\textbackslash{}'s, the astounding growth of the\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nHispanic-American community (currently about 23 million) has rekindled\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ndemands for cultural conformity.<note ref=\"5\">5 <i>Rudolph Vercoli \"The Return of the Melting Pot: Ethnicity in the United States in the Eighties.\"</i>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nJournal of the American Ethnic History, <i>Fall 1985, pages 9-19.</i></note> It is doubtful, though, that the general\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}ninterest in ethnic studies will give way to the extreme pressure for cultural\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nconformity which prevailed between 1917 and 1950. Cultural pluralism will\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nprobably continue to flourish as a balancing force to cultural homogeneity.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nIn any case each generation of Americans has been inclined to reexamine\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nthe age-old question \"What is an American?\"\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n<p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nThe answer to that query has never been static because the populace\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nhas been in constant fluctuation.

Among those is the possibility that America is and\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmust continue to be a pluralistic society composed of ethnic groups who can\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nmake their best contributions to the general welfare by maintaining some\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nnon-American values and traditions. If this is a viable model for American\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nlife, the Holland-American community deserves careful scrutiny; it has\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nstaked out a remarkably large territory for the continued cultivation of its\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}nethnic heritage.\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</p>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</part>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</div3>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</div2>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</div1>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</text>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n</lad>\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n\\textbackslash{}r\\textbackslash{}n'"

The English, Spanish, and Netherlanders who explored the\\r\\nregion came first. They established trading centers such as New\\r\\nAmsterdam and Boston on the fringes of the continent during the\\r\\nseventeenth century.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSince that time &amp;mdash; in fact, since Henry Hudson\\'s exploration in 1609 &amp;mdash;\\r\\nNetherlanders have had continuous connection with North America. New\\r\\nNetherlands, the colony the Dutch founded in 1615, survived until the\\r\\nBritish conquest of 1664. At that time about seven thousand Netherlanders\\r\\nlived in New Amsterdam and the surrounding area. Few new immigrants\\r\\nfrom the mother country joined them until the nineteenth century, when\\r\\nthe most massive population migration in modern times occurred.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBetween 1820 and 1920 more than thirty million Europeans\\r\\nimmigrated to the United States, but of these less than 1 percent were\\r\\nNetherlanders. Unlike the Irish, Germans, and others, the Netherlanders\\r\\ndid not desert their homeland in frenzied massive waves. The first\\r\\nsignificant emigration, guided by A&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Van Raalte, H&amp;dot; P&amp;dot; Scholte, and C&amp;dot;\\r\\nVander Meulen, was planned with great care. And after arriving in\\r\\nAmerica, these first immigrants mailed detailed reports of their experience\\r\\nto families and friends in the mother country. These letters indicate that few\\r\\nimmigrants from Holland entered the New World blindly.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1846, the year that A&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Van Raalte led a group of emigrants from\\r\\nArnhem to Michigan, emigration from the Netherlands totaled about two\\r\\nthousand. That same year fifty thousand Germans migrated to North\\r\\nAmerica. Many of these passed through the Netherlands en route to\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"10\"&gt;\\r\\nRotterdam and Amsterdam, and some arrived on the Dutch coast without\\r\\nenough money to pay for their passage. They became dependents of the\\r\\nDutch government. Trekking along the roads and rivers of Holland, the\\r\\nGerman migrants sparked considerable interest among the poor folk in the\\r\\nNetherlands, but few actually joined the German throng.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAfter the reports from the followers of Van Raalte, Scholte, and others\\r\\nreached the Netherlands, the people began to emigrate in larger numbers,\\r\\nand between 1881 and 1890 that movement peaked at 53,701. Thus, even\\r\\nduring its crest, emigration from the Netherlands was miniscule compared\\r\\nto the movement from Germany, Poland, and elsewhere.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAmericans, whatever their country of origin, retain a lingering but\\r\\nvague acquaintance with the events surrounding the immigration of their\\r\\nancestors. Tales of hardship, followed by success or disappointment, abound.\\r\\nIn recent years many third- and fourth-generation Americans have become\\r\\nnewly interested in the details of the immigration experience. Although this\\r\\nnew concern may have arisen in reaction to black chauvinism in the 1960s,\\r\\nit has developed into a positive force encouraged and supported by the\\r\\nnational government. \"Ethnic Studies\" have become popular in the schools\\r\\nand bookstores of America.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nTo encourage this interest in national origins, the Bentley Historical\\r\\nLibrary of the University of Michigan sent scholars to Europe in search of\\r\\nthe correspondence written by the immigrants of the last century. While\\r\\nother historians investigated the archives of Ireland, Finland, and Poland, I\\r\\nreceived financial assistance enabling me to locate letters written by\\r\\nemigrants from the Netherlands. During six months in 1976, I was able to\\r\\nlocate and photocopy about 1,400 immigrant letters. Some of these letters\\r\\nwere publicly available prior to my search; but I discovered a majority of this\\r\\ncorrespondence in the attics, cupboards, and bookshelves of private homes\\r\\nand farms. Until now, these pages have not been available for public\\r\\nexamination.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDiscovering these letters was a great adventure that led me to\\r\\nhundreds of cities and villages in the Netherlands. Throughout the process I\\r\\nenjoyed help and encouragement from many people in Holland.\\r\\nExperiencing their open-hearted hospitality was an exceptional pleasure.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nLike many other Americans, I have always been aware of my ethnic\\r\\nheritage, and as a historian I have read most of the available literature on\\r\\nDutch-American history. But the experience of living and working among\\r\\nthe people who embody my own European heritage has enriched the\\r\\nmeaning of my study. One hundred and four years after my great-grandfather\\r\\nimmigrated from Drenthe, I was able to visit his birthplace, walk the streets\\r\\nof his youth, and meet the descendants of his neighbors. No book,\\r\\nphotograph, or motion picture can equal the intimacy and satisfaction of\\r\\nthat experience.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHistorians use many sources in their attempts to recreate the past.\\r\\nSome of these, such as minutes of organizations and governmental reports,\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"11\"&gt;\\r\\nyield a rich harvest of data but lack lively human qualities and often reduce\\r\\nthe vitality of experience to relatively bloodless generalizations. I believe\\r\\nthat the letters the immigrants wrote constitute the best source for\\r\\nrediscovering the spirit and character of the immigration.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis book attempts to provide some essential background for the\\r\\nletters, while allowing the immigrants to speak for themselves. Thus, the\\r\\nscope of this story is circumscribed by the availability of immigrant\\r\\ncorrespondence. Fortunately, I was able to discover letters from every major\\r\\nDutch-American settlement in the United States. But for some localities,\\r\\nparticularly New Jersey, a larger number of letters would have been\\r\\ndesirable. In any case, the correspondence portrays the full range of\\r\\nimmigrant experience: ocean travel, wilderness beginnings, life in the cities,\\r\\nand the formation of distinctly Dutch-American institutions in a foreign\\r\\nland. Through all this the immigrants remained deeply interested in the\\r\\nland of their birth. Their correspondence illustrates the validity of a proverb\\r\\nthey often cited, \"Het bloed kruipt waar het niet gaan kan.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWhile acquiring the letters which constitute the heart of this book, I\\r\\nhave accumulated a mountain of debt &amp;mdash; that is, I owe gratitude to literally\\r\\ndozens of Netherlanders. I wish to express appreciation particularly to\\r\\nseveral very helpful friends. No one gave me more time, sound advice, and\\r\\ndelightful companionship than the late Mr&amp;dot; G&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; Ligterink. Together we\\r\\ntraveled the small roads of the &lt;i&gt;achterhoek&lt;/i&gt; and visited dozens of families.\\r\\nFrom them we acquired many of the most interesting letters in this\\r\\ncollection. Professor H&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Prakke and Mr&amp;dot; G&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; Kroessenbrink arranged\\r\\na fruitful newspaper and radio publicity for my search. Others, such as G&amp;dot;\\r\\nBrands, Jr&amp;dot; and J&amp;dot; G&amp;dot; Ter Horst, arranged meetings and spoke for me when I\\r\\nconfronted dialects too complicated for my limited language skills. Just over\\r\\nthe border in Bentheim, the Gerhard Hensen family assisted me generously.\\r\\nWhile in Drenthe, the pleasant hours and letters I shared with the late J&amp;dot; S&amp;dot;\\r\\nWilting remain precious to me. J&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; Niemeijer, who led me to a publisher\\r\\nand the hospitality of his home, will always remain my friend. Our\\r\\nneighbors in Heerde, Mr&amp;dot; and Mrs&amp;dot; Jan Driesten, provided valuable\\r\\nassistance to me, but even more important, they gave their hearts and\\r\\nhands to me and my family. To all of these I wish to express deep\\r\\nappreciation.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThroughout the Netherlands, from Middelburg to Leeuwarden,\\r\\narchivists and librarians provided helpful assistance and sound advice. At\\r\\nthe Free University, Dr&amp;dot; Peter Hoekstra was extraordinarily helpful.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn the United States, the Calvin Seminary Librarian, Peter De Klerk,\\r\\nand the late Mr&amp;dot; George Kamp graciously provided editorial assistance.

Pious immigrants used this biblical metaphor with little\\r\\nhesitation. Even the not-so-pious Thomas Jefferson designed\\r\\nan official seal for the United States which depicted the children of Israel\\r\\ncrossing the Red Sea. And it\\'s not difficult to understand why: crossing the\\r\\nAtlantic was a universal experience among European immigrants, and for\\r\\nmany of them the perils of the passage easily suggested the Jewish Exodus.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Leaders and Routes&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlthough Holland-Americans had no single Moses, a number of\\r\\nreligious leaders did organize large groups of emigrants and guide them to\\r\\nNorth America. Rev&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Van Raalte directed the first band of\\r\\napproximately one thousand emigrants on a 4,000-mile trek which began in\\r\\nArnhem and ended in the Michigan wilderness. Rev&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; P&amp;dot; Scholte\\r\\nchartered three ships to transport nine hundred of his followers to\\r\\nBaltimore; from there they traveled inland to the prairies of Iowa. From\\r\\nZeeland, Rev&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Vander Meulen joined his people on a thirty-three-day\\r\\nvoyage that ended in New York.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSmaller groups followed similar patterns. Rev&amp;dot; M&amp;dot; S&amp;dot; Ypma left\\r\\nFriesland with about fifty followers; after arriving in New York, the group\\r\\ntraveled to western Michigan, where they organized the village of Vriesland.\\r\\nTogether with a majority of his parishioners in Hellendoorn, Rev&amp;dot; S&amp;dot; Bolks\\r\\nsailed from Rotterdam and eventually followed Van Raalte to western\\r\\nMichigan. There Bolks founded the village of Overisel.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"14\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMost of these early emigrants chartered whole vessels and sailed\\r\\ndirectly from Dutch harbors to American ports. Several of the first ships\\r\\nsailed to New Orleans, expecting to avoid overland travel in America by\\r\\nfollowing the Mississippi River northward; but they quickly discovered that\\r\\nthe swift current of the Mississippi hindered rapid travel. Thereafter most\\r\\nemigrants sailed directly to harbors on the Eastern seaboard. Of these, New\\r\\nYork was favored because it provided ready access to the Erie Canal, which\\r\\nled to Buffalo, New York. From that point the immigrants could obtain\\r\\ntransportation on the Great Lakes to ports in Michigan, Illinois, and\\r\\nWisconsin.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nEmigrants traveling singly or in small groups obviously could not\\r\\ncharter whole ships. So many of these travelers crossed the English Channel\\r\\nand took trains overland from Hull to Liverpool. There they joined\\r\\nemigrants from all over Europe and booked passage for North America.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D003\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Travel Tales&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSince sailing the Atlantic was one of the most fearful aspects of\\r\\nemigration, correspondents frequently related this experience in great\\r\\ndetail. In 1846 Hendrich Barendregt traveled to New Orleans and\\r\\ninvestigated that route for Rev&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; P&amp;dot; Scholte. Reporting to his family in\\r\\n`s Gravendeel, Barendregt wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The passage was certainly full of novelty and excitement; I had\\r\\nnever imagined that such a huge ship could be tossed about by the\\r\\nwaves in such a frightening manner. Many times I could not walk so\\r\\nmuch as four or five feet without using two hands to prevent myself\\r\\nfrom falling. This has strengthened me remarkably. Of the whole 180\\r\\npassengers probably but 10 were not seasick, and I was fortunate\\r\\nenough to be among them. On one occasion a huge wave crashed\\r\\nthrough the large hatch; I was soaking wet and my wife, who was\\r\\nalready in bed, was thoroughly drenched. Although I held up well\\r\\nthroughout the trip, at that moment I thought we would be drowned.\\r\\nBut the Lord does all things for our good. We didn\\'t experience\\r\\nanything of special note: eight women gave birth during the voyage\\r\\nwithout help from a doctor or nurse. Of these newborn, two died\\r\\nalong with two other children and an old woman. Thus five died.\\r\\nWhen we came to New Orleans, we sailed up the Mississippi by\\r\\nsteamboat to St&amp;dot; Louis.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Imagine, the distance between New Orleans and St&amp;dot; Louis is\\r\\n500 miles, a trip which took us nine days, all the while traveling amid\\r\\nthe forests. At this point the river is about as wide as the kil in your\\r\\nneighborhood. They cannot use sailing ships here because the current\\r\\nis always strong, and they can\\'t pull the ships with ropes and horses\\r\\nbecause the banks are covered with trees.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"15\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt need hardly be mentioned that travel in the mid-nineteenth\\r\\ncentury required more planning and endurance than it does today. Naturally\\r\\nthe experience of the trans-Atlantic crossing varied a great deal. Rev&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; P&amp;dot;\\r\\nScholte, who was not financially restricted, chartered passage on the\\r\\nsteamship &lt;i&gt;Sarah Sands,&lt;/i&gt; and completed the voyage from Liverpool in just\\r\\nthirteen days, while Rev&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Van Raalte, who sailed on the three-masted\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Southerner&lt;/i&gt; in 1846, remained at sea for fifty-four days.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMany immigrants complained of cramped quarters, poor food, and\\r\\nseasickness. In 1866 a recent immigrant, J&amp;dot; Koke, said, \"I must tell you that\\r\\nseasickness is not at all dangerous, but if some people knew how miserable it\\r\\ncan be, they would stay home.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D004\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nEvert Wonnink, from Geesteren, endured a great deal more than\\r\\nseasickness after embarking from Rotterdam in 1871. After reaching Grand\\r\\nRapids, Michigan, Wonnink reported this experience to his friend B&amp;dot;\\r\\nPeterkamp:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;On Sunday morning at about 4:30 we left Rotterdam and\\r\\npassed alongside Delftshaven, Schiedam, Vlaardingen, and\\r\\nHellevoetsluis.... We lost sight of the Dutch coast finally at\\r\\n10:00... truly an important moment. Further it was continuously\\r\\nwet weather and we came to the tempestuous North Sea. In a short\\r\\ntime everyone was so seasick that they vomited like\\r\\nherons.... Towards evening the seasickness let up and everyone\\r\\ntried to rest their wet bodies, not knowing what we were about to\\r\\nencounter. Still, God knows everything and cares for all things. We\\r\\nsailed nicely until about ten in the evening when suddenly we\\r\\nstopped. The whistles and alarms sounded. We did not yet know what\\r\\nall the commotion was about. We moved slowly forward until\\r\\nsuddenly a great shock came which awakened everyone. Then the\\r\\nwater came pouring into the ship. What wailing! What noise! Death\\r\\nstood before everyone\\'s eyes. Anguished screams, impossible to\\r\\ndescribe, rose from the multitude. Mothers mourned their children,\\r\\nhusbands their wives, and wives their husbands. It was a confusing\\r\\nspectacle. It was God, however, who foresaw our need and he saved\\r\\nus by means of weak human hands. To Him be thanks!&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Everyone climbed on deck to look for help. The sailors were\\r\\nbusy trying to make all possibilities of salvation ready. A French boat,\\r\\nnamed the&lt;/i&gt; Frankland, &lt;i&gt;came directly alongside of us, but the fog was\\r\\nso thick that it was difficult to tie up with each other. Soon the&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\nFrankland &lt;i&gt;was ready to take the people from our ship on board. Our\\r\\nship was sinking so quickly that the passengers stood in water up to\\r\\ntheir knees and their arms, but God kept the water below their lips.\\r\\nEveryone was brought over to the other boat &amp;mdash; no one remained. But\\r\\none German woman fell into the water between the boats.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"16\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Immediately her husband jumped into the water, and because he\\r\\ncould swim, they both returned safely to the ship.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;What a scene! Confusion and emotion reigned among the\\r\\nshipwrecked people. Just think of it! Husbands could not find their\\r\\nwives, mothers could not find their children and babies. Still God\\r\\ncared for us and brought everyone back together. Our possessions\\r\\ncould not be saved because the ship was sinking. When everyone was\\r\\ntransferred, the rope was untied and we continued on our way in the\\r\\nsecond boat. The poor cows, twenty in number, were all lost under\\r\\nthe water.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We thought we were safe, and for the moment that was true.\\r\\nBut then the sailors from the new boat sounded the alarm and sent up\\r\\nfireworks in a most frightful manner. We did not understand what it\\r\\nmeant... but that was good, because if we had known our\\r\\nsituations, we would have been very anxious.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Our second boat had sprung a leak from its collision with our\\r\\nfirst boat, but it was not so great as to cause it to sink quickly.\\r\\nFortunately, and again because of God\\'s goodness, another boat came\\r\\nsailing from behind us and took us in tow. Then we were truly\\r\\nbeyond danger.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I02.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"17\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDespite the loss of all his belongings, Wonnink enjoyed the novelty of\\r\\neach new experience and described them in a delightfully naive fashion.\\r\\n\"England,\" he wrote, \"is a very mountainous land. Thus we had to travel\\r\\nthrough what are called tunnels twelve times. One tunnel was actually so\\r\\nlong that it took half an hour to pass through it, and it was as dark as\\r\\nnight.\" On the sea voyage he reported observing \"brown fish that tossed in\\r\\nthe water and were as large as horses.\" Then on May 5 he reported seeing\\r\\nan iceberg which was only twenty paces off. It was \"as large as the church in\\r\\nGeesteren and looks like a great pile of snow.\" Summarizing this voyage,\\r\\nWonnink concluded, \"There was less seasickness on the ocean than on the\\r\\nNorth Sea. One woman from Sweden died of consumption and five\\r\\nchildren were born. Thus we gained in numbers.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D005\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nW&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; De Lange and his wife also endured a series of mishaps and\\r\\ninconveniences during their journey from Deventer to Grand Rapids. The\\r\\nDe Lange family left Deventer, Overijssel, in 1873, and their difficulties\\r\\nbegan immediately. Mrs&amp;dot; De Lange became temporarily blind, leaving W&amp;dot;\\r\\nH&amp;dot; De Lange with four dependent children and a blind wife to contend with\\r\\nwhile transferring baggage from train to ship and overseeing the\\r\\narrangement of his family in the ship\\'s passenger area. \"From morning until\\r\\nevening,\" he wrote, \"I was soaked through and through with sweat.\" And\\r\\nhe added, \"I would not again make such a trip with a blind wife for $1,000.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDirectly after the De Langes\\' ship left Rotterdam, the sea turned wild\\r\\nand nearly all the passengers were seasick. Soon De Lange, who was not\\r\\nseasick, found himself nursing a hoard of vomiting children. But that was\\r\\nnot the worst of his troubles. In the confusion of transferring baggage at\\r\\nRotterdam, part of his luggage was stolen. Thus, he wrote,\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We had to eat moldy bread, potatoes with sauerkraut or pea\\r\\nsoup &amp;mdash; all with spoiled American bacon, because the stolen luggage,\\r\\ncontained all the food we had packed for the trip, but we didn\\'t realize\\r\\nthat until after we were under way and there was no opportunity to\\r\\nget more. Thus we experienced total poverty, and we could do\\r\\nnothing but bite the sour apple and hope for better. We were at sea for\\r\\n27 days and it was a happy moment when the city of New Jersey\\r\\ncame into sight.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D006\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nToward the end of the century travel conditions improved. The\\r\\nvoyage, first of all, consumed much less time. Also, emigrants who could\\r\\navoid steerage frequently marveled at the lavish fare served in huge\\r\\nquantities by waiters in massive dining rooms. J&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; Brink, writing in 1904,\\r\\nsaid:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The weather was moderately good the first five days, but then\\r\\nthe wind was so strong that... the sea played with the ship as if it\\r\\nwere a nutshell.

We\\r\\ntraveled with 1,000 people, but that was not so many, because the&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"18\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I03.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;ship can carry 2,500. We sat with 100 people at each table &amp;mdash; ten\\r\\ntables and ten waiters &amp;mdash; three times a day. We had meat, eggs, fish,\\r\\ngeese, ducks, and chicken, pastry, and all sorts of fruit, and so much\\r\\nmore that I cannot write it down. For nine days we saw nothing but\\r\\nsky and water.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D007\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe long hours could certainly induce boredom among those who\\r\\nlived in cramped quarters, but for passengers with first-class\\r\\naccommodations, travel could be very pleasant. S&amp;dot; Vis, who sailed to New\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"19\"&gt;\\r\\nYork in 1885, suffered no discernable hardships. Describing a typical day, he\\r\\nwrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;This morning I and an Englishman, together with a few other\\r\\nmen, had breakfast together. Simon came later, but did not feel very\\r\\nwell and is now in his cabin. Last night it was very misty, but this\\r\\nmorning it is very pleasant for walking on the deck. The German\\r\\ncame out of his cabin and said that he now felt very well, but I doubt\\r\\nthat, or he would have been down for breakfast. Of the three women\\r\\npassengers, two have already been seasick. Even the old aunt was\\r\\nleaning over the railing to look at the fish. I find it a little\\r\\nembarrassing too when others are seasick and I feel so well. Just now\\r\\nwe passed a sailship at about 100 meters distance. With full sails it\\r\\nwas a beautiful sight.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The passengers below deck are no longer so adventuresome and\\r\\nhappy as they were yesterday. No doubt they also begin to feel the\\r\\neffects of the waves. I have enjoyed the fresh sea air enormously this\\r\\nmorning, and found a pleasant place in which to sit and read awhile.\\r\\nMy chocolate is like gold here; the women like it very much and it\\r\\nwill certainly be gone by the end of the trip. If one wishes, one can\\r\\npass the time pleasantly with reading, walking, eating, sleeping and so\\r\\nforth. In the long run it will certainly become a little boring, and I\\r\\nwill be happy to see the land again.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt is a curious fact that, with all the potential for misfortune on the\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I04.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"20\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I05.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\nAtlantic Ocean, Dutch immigrants experienced no major disasters in trans-Atlantic\\r\\ncrossings. The greatest travel tragedy occurred on Lake Michigan\\r\\nwhen 127 immigrants from Gelderland and Overijssel lost their lives within\\r\\nsight of their destination. This catastrophe occurred near Sheboygan,\\r\\nWisconsin, in 1847 when a Great Lakes steamer, the &lt;i&gt;Phoenix,&lt;/i&gt; caught fire at\\r\\nsea. Of all those aboard, crew and passengers combined, only 25 survived.\\r\\nThe negligence of the ship\\'s crew and the improper safety precautions\\r\\nsurrounding that event have long endured as a scandalous chapter in the\\r\\nhistory of Great Lakes transportation. Unfortunately, no correspondence\\r\\nwritten by the survivors has been discovered.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D008\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAside from the &lt;i&gt;Phoenix&lt;/i&gt; disaster most Dutch immigrants experienced\\r\\nlittle more than the ordinary discomforts of travel in the nineteenth\\r\\ncentury. Often what occurred when they reached the new world was more\\r\\ntrying than the ocean voyage. For example, Matje Sneller\\'s first encounters\\r\\nin New York were utterly heart-wrenching. Her letter from Alto,\\r\\nWisconsin, to Elburg in the Netherlands still echoes her grief:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Our troubles all started when my husband and three children\\r\\nwere lost. I and my three youngest children had been put on a wagon\\r\\nwith others, and the driver drove so swiftly that my husband could not\\r\\nkeep up with us. Hendrikje had the measles on board ship and was so\\r\\npale and weak, and Driesje could not walk, so they were left behind\\r\\nwith father. When the wagon landed at the station, I had to stand\\r\\nwhile the others went inside, and my sister Aaltje left me too. Gerritje\\r\\nwas in the wagon with a girl. I called for my child but I couldn\\'t get\\r\\nGerritje and the wagon left. I called as loud as I could and thee I\\r\\nstood with Dries in my arms and Wichgertje holding my hand. Then I\\r\\nwent back to the house where we had been before, and when they lit\\r\\nthe lamps, there was my husband.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"21\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;This was Saturday and on Monday we left, arriving at Albany\\r\\non Tuesday. There the others were waiting. I asked my sister,\\r\\n\"Where is the child (Gerritje)?\" She said, \"She has already been\\r\\nburied.\" What a shock that was for me. Dries had severe diarrhea,\\r\\nwas wet and soiled and could not walk. Wichgertje had the measles\\r\\nand couldn\\'t walk either. I had to carry one. There was no one to\\r\\nhelp me so I could not rest. You can imagine how worried I was. I\\r\\nkept going till the last evening when I could go no more and I fainted.\\r\\nThen my sister took the child (Dries), otherwise she did not help me.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;They carried me to a baker. There we slept till morning when\\r\\nLubbert got us. I was so glad to get to Alto on Sunday. On Monday\\r\\nI gave birth to a baby girl and remained quite strong. All the while\\r\\nDries became weaker and he died on Thursday next to me in my bed.\\r\\nThus you can understand what an awful time I had. When the baby\\r\\nwas a week old, she also died because in my weakened condition she\\r\\nhad not gotten enough nourishment. This took away all my desire and\\r\\npleasure. Otherwise I think I could enjoy being here.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Now I\\'m well and strong, which surprised many people. I had\\r\\nto say, \"The Lord gives strength to bear our cross.\" So many people\\r\\ncame to call on me to console me in my grief, and they brought plenty\\r\\nof food. How often I have thought of you, my dear sister. I cannot\\r\\nwrite anymore because I am distressed by the loss of our beloved\\r\\nchildren.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D009\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Advice to Friends&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHaving once experienced the toils of ocean travel, some immigrants\\r\\nprovided detailed instructions for family members who were thinking about\\r\\nemigration.

There are many\\r\\nHollanders there who can instruct you in everything. With God\\'s\\r\\nblessing you can earn a great amount of money there. If you intend to\\r\\ncome to America, make certain that you provide yourselves with\\r\\nwoolen clothing, linen and woolen yard goods. Cotton is no more\\r\\nexpensive here than by you. Also, bring a spinning wheel and a clock.\\r\\nClocks here are cheap, but of poor quality. Tobacco here is both\\r\\nexpensive and poor.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;To get ready for ocean travel prepare yourself with potatoes,\\r\\nbuckwheat flour, beans, dried meat and bacon, pepper, salt, vinegar,\\r\\ncoffee, and especially tea. You have many difficulties to attend on the\\r\\ntrip. In the city from which you depart, buy a small vat of salted fish.\\r\\nMake sure that you buy another small vat with a spigot which you\\r\\nmust use to get your daily supply of water, and fill it before you leave.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"22\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D010\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nRoelof Brinks, whose mother hoped he would return to the\\r\\nNetherlands and bring her to Michigan, offered explicit advice to both his\\r\\nmother and brother.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Mother, you want me to bring you here too, and I would like to\\r\\ndo it, but you know that I am married and I am bound to my wife.\\r\\nMy wife and children cannot manage the farm while I am gone, and\\r\\nit would cost at least 400 gulden for me to leave the farm and I\\r\\ncannot do that.

I have already spoken to him about this matter\\r\\nand he has agreed to help you. I will pay him a rijksdaalder for his\\r\\ntrouble, but you will have to pay the expense of travel yourself.

Make\\r\\nsmall trunks, able to be handled by two men. From the baker you\\r\\nshould get rye and wheat bread, slice them thick and let them dry.\\r\\nTake along 50 pounds of buckwheat meal, 60 pounds of bacon, 1\\r\\npiece of dried meat, 5 pounds of sugar, 1 bottle of brandy, a small keg\\r\\nof beer, butter, coffee, tea, shelled barley, rice, and beans. You must\\r\\nget all of these things because everyone must have 200 pounds of food\\r\\nto feed themselves aboard ship.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;When you reach New York, don\\'t sell the remaining food\\r\\nbecause you still have a long trip ahead of you. My sister should not\\r\\ncut her hair this winter because women wear long hair here. But you\\r\\ncan sell your silver caps; they are not worn here. Both linen and wool\\r\\nare expensive here, so take along some yarn for stockings, also 5\\r\\ncubits of black cloth for clothing, 4 cubits of coat material, and 6\\r\\ncubits of skirt material. You can buy all of this in any Dutch city.\\r\\nTake along your church books, one Bible and one New Testament.\\r\\nYou should also take both volumes of Brakel along. Take a copper\\r\\nkettle and also a waan....&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Tell my brother not to wander away from you in the cities and\\r\\nget lost. Look after your baggage and your money &amp;mdash; wrap it around\\r\\nyour body. Brother, when you are on the train, don\\'t put your head\\r\\nout of the window, and don\\'t linger outside of the train when it stops,\\r\\nor you will get left behind.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nArmed with such advice, prospective immigrants were well-prepared\\r\\nfor travel, and many, like A&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; Palmbos, sought precise information about\\r\\nthe details of arrival and overland transportation. \"When I come to New\\r\\nYork,\" young Palmbos wrote, \"must I take care of myself or will I find people\\r\\nthere who will help me? Must I change connections in New York for Grand\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"23\"&gt;\\r\\nRapids? If so &amp;mdash; where? Can I use the ticket I get in Rotterdam for the whole\\r\\ntrip to Grand Rapids or must I buy another in New York? What is the full\\r\\nprice for the whole trip at second-class rate?\" In answering these and\\r\\nquestions of every sort, the first immigrants provided their European friends\\r\\nwith a wide range of information about life in America. In a stream of\\r\\nletters, which poured back into the Netherlands from every corner of North\\r\\nAmerica, they described their successes and disappointments in farming,\\r\\nfactory work, and in a variety of professions.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"25\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D011\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div2 name=\"Chapter 2 Michigan: A Model for Ethnic Solidarity\" type=\"chapter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;D&lt;/b&gt;utch-Americans, who constitute a very small percentage of the\\r\\ngeneral American populace, have maintained a remarkable\\r\\ndegree of cohesion and identity. As a result, the regions they\\r\\nfirst occupied one hundred thirty years ago &amp;mdash; western\\r\\nMichigan, the Chicago area, and several portions of Wisconsin and lowa &amp;mdash;\\r\\nare still heavily populated and influenced by their descendants.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAll these settlements, except lowa, combined both agricultural and\\r\\nurban opportunities, offering a large variety of employment within easy\\r\\nreach of the ethnic neighborhoods. Poorer immigrants who hoped to\\r\\nbecome farmers could first find employment in factories or mills, later using\\r\\ntheir savings to purchase farms among their countrymen on the fringes of\\r\\nthe city. Some of these immigrants became garden farmers, finding ready\\r\\nmarkets in the urban areas from which they had moved. Meanwhile,\\r\\ncountry boys who preferred business or mechanical trades drifted to the\\r\\ncities.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBy the 1870s Dutch communities in Michigan, Chicago, and\\r\\nWisconsin boasted ethnic churches and schools supported by a constituency\\r\\nof artisans and farmers. Arriving in these neighborhoods between 1870 and\\r\\n1920, new immigrants found their own people, language, and institutions.\\r\\nBy the mid-twentieth century, when urban blight spoiled the attractions of\\r\\ncity life, many urban Dutch-Americans joined their country cousins who\\r\\nhad established agricultural communities on the metropolitan fringes. These\\r\\nnew suburbanites were again able to enjoy familiar social patterns, including\\r\\nthe churches, schools, and general mores they had previously supported in\\r\\ntheir urban neighborhoods.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"26\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis conveniently pleasant arrangement of urban-rural mobility\\r\\noccurred first in western Michigan. Albertus C&amp;dot; Van Raalte, who founded\\r\\nhis colony on the shores of Lake Michigan, had neither planned nor\\r\\nencouraged this arrangement. But economic necessity forced his followers to\\r\\nsend their children off among the Americans as hired hands, housemaids,\\r\\nand factory workers. They scattered in all directions: Allegan, Grand\\r\\nHaven, and Grand Rapids. Among these, Grand Rapids offered the best\\r\\nopportunities for employment. In addition, a pious Zeelander named H&amp;dot;\\r\\nVan Driel had already organized a Dutch-language worship service there in\\r\\n1848. Thus, only one year after Van Raalte\\'s people occupied the wooded\\r\\nshore of Black Lake, Van Driel was reading Dutch sermons to an audience\\r\\nwhich included over one hundred young women who were providing\\r\\ndomestic service among the American families of Grand Rapids. By 1851, it\\r\\nis estimated that a total of four hundred Hollanders were living in Grand\\r\\nRapids.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Michigan Background&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe Netherlanders who settled in western Michigan were, of course,\\r\\nnot the first Europeans to investigate that corner of the North American\\r\\nwilderness. As early as 1620 the French had used this area to trade with\\r\\nIndian tribes. And in 1688 Father Jacques Marquette, a missionary-explorer,\\r\\nfounded a permanent village at Saulte Sainte Marie. Since other French\\r\\nmissionaries organized mission stations all along the coast of Lake\\r\\nMichigan, it\\'s not surprising that in 1847 Van Raalte and his followers met a\\r\\ntribe of Christian Indians on the future site of Holland, Michigan.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMichigan afforded Van Raalte a better opportunity to isolate his\\r\\ncolony than did the neighboring states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, all of\\r\\nwhich had been settled and organized earlier than the Wolverine State.\\r\\nSince Michigan did not gain independent statehood until 1837, Van Raalte\\r\\nwas able to acquire large tracts of unsettled land for his group.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWhy was Michigan so slow to develop? Many people were scared off\\r\\nby the surveyors\\' reports in 1812. After describing a territory that consisted\\r\\nof swamps, lakes, and poor sandy soil not worth the cost of additional\\r\\ninvestigation, these reports asserted, \"Not more than one acre in a\\r\\nhundred... would admit of cultivation.\" It was further assumed that such\\r\\na region would be very unhealthy for human occupation.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlthough these reports had been proven false by the time Van Raalte\\r\\narrived in Detroit seeking a place to found his colony, Van Raalte\\'s followers\\r\\nwould soon be able to attest that there was more than a grain of truth in the\\r\\nearly surveyors\\' words: some regions, including much of the land\\r\\nsurrounding Holland, Michigan, &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; swampy areas which could not be\\r\\nutilized for many years.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nVan Raalte\\'s efforts in Holland, Michigan, paralleled similar efforts\\r\\namong his American neighbors. The towns and villages in the colony\\'s\\r\\nimmediate vicinity were all youthful and crude, having origins as trading\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"27\"&gt;\\r\\nposts or Indian settlements. Port Sheldon, the colony\\'s nearest neighbor,\\r\\nhad been developed in 1837 for reasons much like those which Van Raalte\\r\\ncherished in selecting Holland. Like Holland, Port Sheldon had access to\\r\\nLake Michigan through an adjoining inland lake that provided a potential\\r\\nharbor. But Port Sheldon had been organized by speculators who hoped to\\r\\nlure purchasers with the promise of spiraling land values. The founders\\r\\nconstructed a huge hotel on the site and had already sold some of the town\\r\\nlots when the economic crisis of 1837 pulled land values down and forced\\r\\nthe town\\'s developers into bankruptcy. Van Raalte proceeded more wisely.\\r\\nHis colony consisted of settlers, not empty projections of speculative wealth.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nVan Raalte\\'s experiment was, however, rather unique. Americans did\\r\\nnot expect fresh European immigrants to settle in the wilderness. That, they\\r\\ncommonly believed, was the peculiar task of the tough American\\r\\nfrontiersmen. In 1831 Alexis de Tocqueville, the well-known author of\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Democracy in America,&lt;/i&gt; recorded this typical view in the words of a Michigan\\r\\nfrontiersman. Asked why so few recent European immigrants could be found\\r\\nin the Michigan wilderness, the frontiersman replied:\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;None but the Americans are brave enough to submit to such\\r\\nprivation, and are willing to pay such a price for [success]. The\\r\\nEuropean immigrant stops in the large towns of the seaboard, or in\\r\\nsurrounding districts. There he becomes a mechanic, a laborer, or a\\r\\nservant. He leads an easier life than in Europe, and appears content\\r\\nthat his children should follow his example. The American takes\\r\\npossession of the land and tries to create out of it a great social\\r\\nposition.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\nThis frontiersman was clearly ignorant of the many exceptions to his\\r\\nopinion, but in general what he said was true: new immigrants tended to\\r\\noccupy lands which others had tamed.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D012\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe Dutch suffered great hardships as a consequence of their decision\\r\\nto occupy primitive regions. Although choosing unsettled land permitted\\r\\nthem to acquire property directly from the government at $1.25 per acre,\\r\\nthey were forced to add years of toil to that price before the land was\\r\\ntillable. Tocqueville, describing the sort of wilderness these immigrants\\r\\ntamed, wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;As we proceeded, we gradually lost sight of the traces of\\r\\nman.... Before us was the scene that we had so long been\\r\\nseeking &amp;mdash; the primitive forest.... Full-grown trees, almost all pines\\r\\nor oaks, were so confined to so narrow a space that each of these\\r\\ntrees had run up rapidly in search of air and light. As straight as the\\r\\nmast of a ship, the most rapid grower had overtopped every\\r\\nsurrounding object.... Others followed quickly... and the whole\\r\\ngroup formed a sort of immense canopy. Underneath this damp\\r\\nmotionless vault the scene is different.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"28\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I06.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Majesty and order are overhead &amp;mdash; near the ground all is chaos\\r\\nand confusion: aged trunks, incapable any longer of supporting their\\r\\nbranches, are shattered in the middle and present nothing but a sharp\\r\\njagged point. Others have been thrown unbroken to the\\r\\nground.... Huge trees, sustained by surrounding branches, hang in\\r\\nmid air, and fall into dust without reaching the ground.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D013\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Rural Villages&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe Dutch colony in Michigan began amid similarly primeval forests.\\r\\nNo plow could turn the soil until the woodland growth of centuries,\\r\\ntogether with its rubble, was removed and burned. Timber from these huge\\r\\ntrees became the first log houses, barns, and churches of Holland and its\\r\\nneighboring settlements. These Dutch-American villages, among which\\r\\nHolland was the leading example, sprang up over a fifty-year period.\\r\\nImmigrants, following the example of Van Raalte and his group, came singly\\r\\nor in clusters, locating their villages with an eye on two characteristics:\\r\\narable land and sufficient isolation to permit the retention of Dutch culture.\\r\\nOnce established, these villages attracted additional immigrants and\\r\\ncontinued to grow until the land was taken up or had become too\\r\\nexpensive.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFrequently the founders of these villages had been neighbors in the\\r\\nNetherlands, and they named their new towns after their places of origin.\\r\\nThus, Dominie Vander Meulen from Zeeland founded Zeeland, Michigan,\\r\\nand Dominie S&amp;dot; Bolks from Overijssel established Overisel, Michigan. By\\r\\n1900 the Dutch-Americans had come to occupy and frequently dominate\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"29\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I07.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\nlarge portions of several counties in western and central Michigan. The\\r\\nnames of their villages &amp;mdash; Drenthe, Harlem, Zutphen, Groningen, and\\r\\nVriesland &amp;mdash; read like a map of the Netherlands.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe history of Holland, Michigan, has been recorded in several\\r\\nexcellent books. Interestingly, the main contours of that story exhibit\\r\\npatterns similar to those of other successful frontier settlements. In 1846,\\r\\nwith about one hundred companions, Rev&amp;dot; Albertus C&amp;dot; Van Raalte migrated\\r\\nfrom Arnhem in the Dutch province of Gelderland to Detroit, Michigan.\\r\\nBecause the Great Lakes channels froze early in 1846, Van Raalte\\'s party\\r\\nremained in Detroit for the winter. Meanwhile, their leader sought a proper\\r\\nlocation for their settlement. After abandoning his preference for\\r\\nWisconsin, Van Raalte traveled to western Michigan and joined company\\r\\nwith Judge John R&amp;dot; Kellogg from Allegan. Together they viewed lands along\\r\\nthe Grand River and the area surrounding Black Lake. After considerable\\r\\ninvestigation, Van Raalte decided to purchase some four thousand acres on\\r\\nthe fringes of Black Lake, for he was convinced that its access to Lake\\r\\nMichigan would facilitate the development of a busy harbor port. To achieve\\r\\nall this, Van Raalte used funds from his own purse and from associates in the\\r\\nNetherlands, but he also acquired loans from sympathetic supporters in New\\r\\nYork.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe earliest efforts at colony building were attended by back-breaking\\r\\nlabor, hunger, and much grief. Along with the unfamiliar tasks of\\r\\npioneering, the colonists suffered a siege of malaria which invaded nearly\\r\\nevery family. Despite these setbacks, the immigrants were hopeful and\\r\\noccasionally euphoric about the future of the colony. In 1847 Gerrit Bouws\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"30\"&gt;\\r\\nreported, \"I wish that all who seek the Lord could be here for they would no\\r\\nlonger be surrounded by ungodliness. Here in the colony a man can earn 50\\r\\ncents per day, but among the Americans he can earn more. I must say that\\r\\nthose who are healthy can earn their keep with God\\'s blessing.\" More\\r\\nspecifically he noted, \"It is good for carpenters here, and for shoemakers, as\\r\\npeople wear out many shoes here. Roofers and wooden-shoe makers will find\\r\\nless work here. The houses are roofed with wood planks and can be built\\r\\nquickly &amp;mdash; in about three days with four men. Now friends, I invite all who\\r\\nare healthy and desire to work... come. It is good for everyone here.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D014\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFor Zwiertje Veldhuis, even the grief of losing her husband and two\\r\\nchildren did not destroy her resolve to succeed. \"I am happy that the Lord\\r\\nbrought us to this country,\" she wrote. \"Thus far I have not been in want,\\r\\nand that was not true in the Netherlands. America is a land flowing with\\r\\nmilk and honey. If our ancestors could see how we burn wood here, it would\\r\\nbe unbelievable to them.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nOf her farm, Zwiertje wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We have purchased 160 acres which my husband found very\\r\\ngood. He would have preferred to accomplish more here on earth, but\\r\\nthe Bible says, \"My ways are not your ways, and your ways are not\\r\\nmy ways.\" We can see the truth of that every day here.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We are now living in the house that the Lord allowed us to\\r\\nbuild, for we could not have done it by our own strength. When we\\r\\nmoved into the house, my husband was able to work with the\\r\\ncarpenter and we were thankful for that blessing.... Now we are\\r\\nworking further on our house. Our hired man is gathering trees\\r\\ntogether with the oxen and three other men. We did not finish burning\\r\\nthe trees because planting was more urgent. We have sown five acres\\r\\nof corn, an acre each of oats and grass, and two acres of potatoes\\r\\nand buckwheat. If the Lord graciously permits us to burn more wood,\\r\\nwe will plant another six acres of corn.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1848 thirty houses were clustered near the shore of Black Lake. A\\r\\nwood mill and a grain mill were producing lumber and flour, and salt and\\r\\nand potash were already being exported to Chicago.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D015\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBy 1849, two hundred homes lined the streets of the Dutch village.\\r\\nWriting to a friend in Bloomington, Illinois, that year, H&amp;dot; Van Eijk\\r\\nreported:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The conditions in the colony appear to be more favorable right\\r\\nalong. Factories, craftsmen, and businesses are beginning to flourish.\\r\\nAlmost all summer, the mouth of Black Lake was open, and there\\r\\nwere vessels at the city dock off and on. Laborers have earned good\\r\\nwages peeling hemlock bark for the tanneries, splitting wood for the\\r\\ncopper, and cutting wood for fuel &amp;mdash; and that makes for a busy trade\\r\\nwith Chicago. The government in Washington sent twenty experts to&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"31\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;measure the mouth of the Black River, and they reported that if piers\\r\\nwere built at the mouth of the river to stop the sand from blocking the\\r\\nentrance, we could have the best harbor and trade center along the\\r\\nlakeshore. This report, combined with the support and good\\r\\nreputation which Van Raalte enjoys from the U&amp;dot;S&amp;dot; Congress and\\r\\nPresident, leaves no doubt about our receiving a $45,000\\r\\nappropriation to build the piers and promote our Dutch colony.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nConcerning other aspects of economic development, Van Eijk wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Farmers who raised crops as soon as their land was cleared are\\r\\nalready doing a good business, and the cleared land [which cost $1.25\\r\\nper acre] is being resold for from $4 to $6 per acre. The number of\\r\\nhouses has tripled. Homes in the city now bring $100 where at first\\r\\nthey sold for $45. A steam-and wind-driven mill are fully operative in\\r\\nthe city, and there are, in addition, two water-driven mills, at one of\\r\\nwhich I am the foreman.

We harvested nearly 600 bushels of\\r\\npotatoes, and that when many others suffered damage from the blight.\\r\\nThe Lord has blessed us wonderfully.... We harvested about 60\\r\\nbushels of corn which is not enough for our livestock, but in the\\r\\nwinter, corn is very cheap....

These villages, and Zeeland in\\r\\nparticular, flourished almost immediately. By 1854, Zeeland had already\\r\\nattracted about one thousand residents, and its taxable real estate nearly\\r\\nequaled that of Holland. Most of the Dutch settlements, however, remained\\r\\nessentially rural villages &amp;mdash; churches and schools along with a general store\\r\\nand blacksmith shop &amp;mdash; sustained by the farms that dotted the nearby section\\r\\nroads.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D017\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nRev&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; Zwemer, who accepted a call to be the minister of the\\r\\nVriesland Dutch Reformed Church in 1860, gave a detailed description of\\r\\nthat village in a letter to his friend, Rev&amp;dot; Helenius De Kok:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We no longer live in Holland (the principal city of the colony),\\r\\nbut in Vriesland, 10 miles (3 hours afoot) to the east of Holland.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The congregation of Vriesland is located to the east of the\\r\\ncolony. Our church is 10 miles from the church in Holland, and 4\\r\\nmiles from the church in Zeeland. (One mile is about 20 minutes\\r\\nwalking). The members of the church come from 76 families. About\\r\\n90 families here are church-going. The whole village consists of about\\r\\n95 &amp;mdash; 96 families with a total population of about 500 people. Almost\\r\\nwithout exception they all live on farms.

Dominie Vander Meulen has\\r\\nreceived a call from Chicago and will leave the colony.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;My wife is feeling rather well and strong; she feels much better\\r\\nsince we have moved to Michigan in the woods, than when we lived\\r\\nin a small corner of the highly populated city. A snake, named loopin\\r\\nhere, does not frighten our children, and it is quite common to see\\r\\nhummingbirds (the smallest and most beautiful of birds) flying around\\r\\nthe flower garden to get sap from the flowers. Wild cats, foxes,\\r\\nraccoons, and other little animals still frequently do damage in the\\r\\nhen houses. When these woods were first settled, the howling of the\\r\\nwolves echoed through the night; now they are no longer heard. There\\r\\nare still one or two bears in the neighborhood and they are still seen\\r\\noccasionally. But they seem to understand that the Hollanders have\\r\\nbought these woodlands and that they no longer roam on their own\\r\\nland; for they are afraid of people; but the young people wish there\\r\\nwere more bears around in order to hunt for them.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D018\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nImmigrants were frequently fascinated by the novelties of their new\\r\\nhomes. Peter J&amp;dot; Bulthuis, who worked in the Mill Point sawmills, wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We still have wild animals in this area such as bears, wolves,\\r\\nand bobcats, but they are off in the deep woods. In the long winters\\r\\nwhen the snow is deep, they come out onto the farms so that farmers\\r\\ncan hear the wolves howling during the night. I talked to one farmer\\r\\nwho told me that he was out late one evening after a fresh snow and\\r\\nhe could see from the tracks that a bear had crossed his path. He\\r\\nfeared for his life, but luckily the bear wandered off into the woods\\r\\nbefore the farmer turned off on his own path. On another occasion I\\r\\nwas told of three people who met each other on the road just as a bear\\r\\ncame out of the woods. Two of them ran off and left the third to\\r\\nconfront the bear. The man was saved by the faithfulness of his dog,\\r\\nfor as the bear came at him, the dog bit the bear so many times that\\r\\nhe gave up his attack and the man ran away. In that way he escaped.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The Indians are not afraid of bears, for they live by fishing and\\r\\nhunting. They say that when you see a bear, you should look for a\\r\\nthick tree which you can reach more quickly than the bear, and once\\r\\nin the tree, as the bear follows, you must hit him in the nose with\\r\\nyour axe, and then the bear will quickly run off.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;But you should not be frightened by these tales, because the\\r\\nbear do not often come out and then only during very long winters\\r\\nwith very deep snow, and also only during the late evening when\\r\\npeople are out in the woods. We have no trouble from these matters&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"35\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;in the village. And if you like to hunt, we have wild animals here such\\r\\nas deer, rabbit, partridge, ducks, geese, and doves.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I have also not yet written about the Indians. They are a people\\r\\nwith a somewhat brown skin. They are always in the woods. They\\r\\nlive by seeking a pile of sticks, which they bind together at the top and\\r\\nthen spread out in a regular pattern at the bottom. Then they place a\\r\\nfire in the center of their house and lay their children around the fire.\\r\\nIn the evening they build a large fire and lie around the fire. The\\r\\nwomen cover themselves with a blanket, and the women wear a\\r\\nblanket during the daytime also. They have their own language.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D019\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Old Friends in New Places&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlthough the immigrants found much to entertain and charm them in\\r\\nthe New World, they were even more grafitied to meet old friends and hear\\r\\nthe familiar sounds of their native language and dialects. After weeks of\\r\\ntravel and uncertainty, newly arriving immigrants entered comfortable\\r\\nvillages like Vriesland with tears of joy. That they could feel so much at\\r\\nhome so far from their homeland often astounded them, particularly after\\r\\nexperiencing the bewildering maze of novelty forced upon them by travel. In\\r\\n1866 J&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Koke, describing his arrival in Vriesland, Michigan, wrote, \"We\\r\\ncame here at about 6 P&amp;dot;M&amp;dot; on Tuesday, and I cannot describe the joy which\\r\\nwe all felt. The tears flowed just as they did when we said goodbye in\\r\\nGermany.\" From Mill Point in 1854 Marcus Nienhuis said, \"In this strange\\r\\nland we find ourselves among so many countrymen and friends that it is\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I09.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"36\"&gt;\\r\\nalmost impossible to believe that we are in a strange land.\" Nienhuis\\r\\ncontinued:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I took a trip to the colony and met a friend of yours. I saw the\\r\\nwoman standing in her doorway and asked some directions. As soon\\r\\nas she opened her mouth, I could tell that she was from Drenthe and\\r\\nI asked if she was the wife of Harm Smidt. In surprise she answered,\\r\\n\"Yes, but how do you know me since you are clearly from\\r\\nGroningen?\" I explained that I knew about them from you, and then\\r\\nof course I had to have a look at their place, and I was well impressed\\r\\nwith it, particularly since I know what little they had in Hogeveen.\\r\\nThey have a sparkling house with two large rooms, a kitchen, a\\r\\nbasement, barn and stalls, all of which were well built. They also\\r\\nhave thirty-six acres of cleared land along with a piece of wooded&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I10.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"37\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;land, and in addition they have more wooded land nearby.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMeetings of this sort were frequent among the new immigrants.\\r\\nVirtually all their letters report the joys and sorrows of mutual friends in the\\r\\nNew World. News of births, deaths, the comings and goings of ministers,\\r\\nand general advice to prospective immigrants flowed constantly to all\\r\\ncorners of the Netherlands. By reading the correspondence from Michigan,\\r\\ninterested Netherlanders could acquire a remarkable degree of information\\r\\nabout conditions in and around Van Raalte\\'s colony.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D020\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Success on the Farm&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nCompared to the Netherlands, Michigan is a huge mass of land. In\\r\\nthe nineteenth century it was also an unsettled, uncrowded territory. It\\r\\nmust have sounded like the promised land to the Dutch immigrants who\\r\\nhad come from the cramped blocks of cities in the Netherlands. These\\r\\nimmigrants, especially those who arrived early in the state\\'s development,\\r\\nwere able to select homesteads from a liberal supply of available land.\\r\\nUltimately they occupied over two thousand square miles in their adopted\\r\\nstate, an area equal to almost one-sixth of their homeland. Today\\r\\nNetherlanders can be found in significant numbers in at least forty &lt;lacuna&gt;\\r\\nand cities scattered throughout western and central Michigan.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe steady acquisition of agricultural land in Michigan satisfied the\\r\\ndesires of many Dutch-Americans for whom farm ownership stood more\\r\\nhighly than all other material goals. Some immigrants, who had not been\\r\\nfarmers in the Netherlands, proudly reported their agricultural successes to\\r\\nfriends and family members back home.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFor example, in 1854 Marcus Nienhuis wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;On the 27th of January, 16 members of our family arrived here\\r\\nin good health, and that meeting gave my morale a great boost. I have\\r\\nworked in the sawmill here since April 15 and I earn $26 per month,\\r\\nwhich equals 65 guilders in Dutch currency. Of this I spend $8, or\\r\\n20 guilders for room and board and this, I think, is good wages. It is,\\r\\nof course, true that I must work hard for this, but it is easy to\\r\\nunderstand that no one will pay such wages for nothing. But it is still\\r\\ntrue that people are not treated like dogs here, and I don\\'t have to\\r\\nwork as hard here as when I sailed as ship hand in Holland.&lt;/i&gt;...\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Brother Martinus will also be coming here to Mill Point in a\\r\\nfew days and will also work in the mill for $1 per day; along with that\\r\\nhe gets free housing and heating fuel. The rest of the family works on\\r\\nthe docks in Grand Haven and they also earn good wages. Some days\\r\\nthey earn from $2.50 to $4 per day. Martin Reenders has on one\\r\\noccasion earned $5 in a half day. But then they do not work every\\r\\nday; otherwise they would be rich in a hurry.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I tell you without falsehood that it is much better for a worker\\r\\nhere than by you. There are some among you who grumble about this&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"38\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I11.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;country, but I tell you that that is a crazy prejudice acquired without\\r\\nprior information for their judgment. Believe me, if I did not have\\r\\nbetter opportunities here than by you, then I would not tell you it was\\r\\nbetter here and I would also return quickly.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Last spring I rode around for 20 days to find what might be\\r\\nsome good land to purchase, and just now I have looked about for 8\\r\\ndays, because it is our primary goal to acquire land. It is important to\\r\\nsee some land and what kind people are buying. Not all the land is\\r\\ngood. In addition, some land is too far away from water and train\\r\\ntransportation with the result that you can\\'t get your crops to market.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;During my last search I have found something which looks good\\r\\nto me. But for the moment I can\\'t buy it from the government\\r\\nbecause they plan to run a railroad through that area and the precise\\r\\nroute is not yet determined. As soon as the route is established and\\r\\nlaid out, we intend to buy land there. The land is located in North\\r\\nHolland, part of Van Raalte\\'s colony where almost none but\\r\\nHollanders live. I have already purchased 80 acres of woodland there\\r\\nfor $120 from a party who bought it from the government. There are\\r\\nstill two 80-acre parcels next to mine which the government owns,\\r\\nand we would like to buy that too as soon as it is available. These 80-acre\\r\\npieces can be purchased for $100 each. Then we will have it all\\r\\ntogether &amp;mdash; Tamme Wybes Dykema, a brother-in-law of brother\\r\\nMartinus, and I. Eighty acres is a little more than 30 bunders in the\\r\\nNetherlands.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIf Nienhuis had saved eighteen dollars per month he would have\\r\\naccumulated the price of an eighty-acre parcel in just six months. In any\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"39\"&gt;\\r\\ncase he moved to his North Holland farm by February, 1855. During his first\\r\\nfew years there he probably made good use of the lumbering skills he had\\r\\nlearned in Mill Point. The sawmills usually closed down during winter\\r\\nmonths, and part of the work force then moved to the forests to cut trees for\\r\\nthe reopening of the mills after the spring thaw. It was common practice to\\r\\ncut the trees during the winter when they could be hauled over the slippery\\r\\nsnow to the river. In the spring, when the river became a rushing torrent\\r\\ndue to thawing snow and ice, the logs were floated downriver to Mill Point,\\r\\nwhere they piled up for use by the sawmills.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNienhuis probably used these winter months to clear a part of his land\\r\\nand returned to work in the sawmills during the summer. There he could\\r\\naccumulate more cash to clear the land he had purchased.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt was quite common for the poorer immigrants to work in nearby\\r\\ncities while clearing a farm in the colony. This pattern is exemplified by\\r\\nGeert Heerspink, who worked in Allegan while buying and clearing a farm\\r\\nin Holland. In 1850 he wrote to his brother, \"We have 56 acres of land in\\r\\nthe colony, with a house and two acres cleared. If the Lord will and we live,\\r\\nwe plan to move there in April.\" Then commenting on the colony itself,\\r\\nHeerspink wrote, \"Netherlanders are blessed far above others in this\\r\\ncountry &amp;mdash; in the Holland colony there are seven churches and six ministers.\\r\\nThe children are educated in both the Dutch and English language, with\\r\\nspecial attention to the teaching of salvation.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D021\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nImmigrants with more cash than Heerspink could carve farms from\\r\\nthe wilderness with less difficulty, since they could hire their poorer\\r\\nneighbors to help clear the land. Thus, Hendrich Lanning, who immigrated\\r\\nwith a great deal of money, found the New World a virtual paradise. In\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I12.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"40\"&gt;\\r\\nDrenthe, Michigan, he was able to realize a large part of the typical farmer\\'s\\r\\ndesires. And in 1860, thirteen years after he had arrived in America, he\\r\\nwrote that all his sons and daughters had reaped rich benefits from his\\r\\ndecision to leave the Netherlands:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;My oldest daughter is married to Sietse Holt. They live next to\\r\\nme and have two children, a girl and a boy. They have a good farm of\\r\\n133 acres. My oldest son, Albert, lives 10 minutes off from me and is\\r\\nmarried to a daughter of Albert Lubbers. They have four children,\\r\\nthree girls and a boy. Two others of their children have died. They\\r\\nhave a farm of 160 acres and are making good progress. In the hope\\r\\nthat they are in Christ, they have done all this with God\\'s grace,\\r\\nwhich is of greater worth than all earthly riches. My youngest son,\\r\\nKlass, lives next to me and is married to a daughter of P&amp;dot; Huizenga\\r\\nfrom Groningen. They have three children &amp;mdash; two boys and a girl along\\r\\nwith two who died. He has two farms &amp;mdash; one of 100 acres and another\\r\\nof 80 acres.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nLanning\\'s youngest daughter married Dominie Sheppers, one of two\\r\\nministers in the colony adhering to the Presbyterian Church. Thus it is easy\\r\\nto understand Lanning\\'s contentment. Summarizing his satisfaction,\\r\\nLanning wrote, \"It is a fat land here. If we have manure, we use it, but\\r\\nthings grow just as well without it.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D022\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe search for larger and better farms led Dutch-Americans to all\\r\\ncorners of the colony. The Dunnink family, originating from Staphorst,\\r\\nmoved twice between 1850 and 1865. They lived successively in Grandville\\r\\nand Beaverdam. Reporting his first impressions of western Michigan,\\r\\nDunnink wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;This year many Zeelanders came here. They were mainly poor\\r\\nlaborers who had to pool their money to pay for their transportation.\\r\\nNot all of them could find work here in the colony, so they have to\\r\\nearn their bread by working among the Americans. They do well\\r\\nthere, but because of the language problem they have difficulties\\r\\nunderstanding each other.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Many people live in log houses here. The space between the\\r\\nlogs is sealed with clay. These houses are certainly warm, but not\\r\\nelegant. There are no nice roads here, but we are working on them a\\r\\ngreat deal.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Trees are cut down three feet above the ground, then they are\\r\\ncut up and dragged away. Potatoes are planted in the new ground.\\r\\nThey plant two or three in places between the stumps and hoe the\\r\\nground up around them so that it looks like a molehill. Also a great\\r\\ndeal of wheat is raised between the stumps. Farmers make soap from\\r\\nthe ashes of the trees and grease.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Most of our association here has been with the Zeelanders&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"41\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I13.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;because we sell our butter in their village (Zeeland, Michigan). We\\r\\nalso go to church there, and after church the children receive\\r\\ninstruction. The people there are solemn and God-fearing. The\\r\\nlanguage of Canaan is much in use here, and the Bible occupies a very\\r\\nprominent place. There are other kinds of people here too, but they\\r\\nare in deep subjection. It seems that the Lord has preserved this place\\r\\nfor the Netherlanders because almost no Americans settle here, nor\\r\\nare there any strange religious groups here.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I14.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"42\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nContinuing his report in 1851, Dunnink said:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;My oldest daughter, Grietje, was hired out in July. She earns\\r\\n$1 per week. Among the Americans it is not customary for girls to\\r\\nwork in the fields, and the Dutch girls also resist that kind of work &amp;mdash; it\\r\\nis, after all, no work for girls. My daughter enjoys working among\\r\\nthe Americans, but we miss her help at home. We have plenty of\\r\\nwork here with the little children. But the $50 which she earns is also\\r\\na considerable help.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I bought a new plow for $6 and a new clock for $4. The land\\r\\nwhich I farm was purchased from the government, and the price is\\r\\nfixed at $1.25 per acre. Other settlers (in Zeeland, Michigan) have\\r\\npurchased partly cleared land from the third or even fourth settlers,\\r\\nbut that is much more expensive. That land is not of a better quality,\\r\\nbut it is much closer to the church and school. We live about three\\r\\nhours distance from the church and school. Going through the woods\\r\\nit is about five miles from here and one mile is about 20 minutes.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D023\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nReporting further progress in 1853, Dunnink wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I have plowed much of my land, for without plowing, nothing\\r\\nwill grow besides weeds. It takes about two years for the old grass,\\r\\nweeds, and leaves to decay and in the third year you can begin to\\r\\nwork the ground. But even then you can\\'t cultivate near the stumps.\\r\\nStill, that gets better from year to year. I have plowed out many small\\r\\nstumps from the land that I cleared first, and that is a lot of work &amp;mdash;\\r\\nnot only with the stumps but also with the digging and cutting of the\\r\\nold roots. And there is more work connected with hauling them away\\r\\nto be burned.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;For the past two years we have had very poor crops. One year\\r\\nit was too wet, and the next year it was so dry that we could hardly\\r\\nplow the land properly. But we have always been able to make our\\r\\nway. We had potatoes, butter, milk, and beans from our own farm,\\r\\nand by making wood shingles, I\\'ve been able to earn enough money\\r\\nto pay our expenses. I don\\'t know exactly how much land I have\\r\\ncleared here, but I think about 30 acres are now cut and of that 12\\r\\nacres are cleared for cultivation.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;In the midst of writing this letter we experienced difficulties here\\r\\nso that I cannot continue this letter in the same vein. I have lost my\\r\\nlittle son, Albert. He was sick for just four days, and we thought that\\r\\nhe had a cold. During the last day he did not eat, and during the night\\r\\nhis chest was congested so that I went to the doctor for medicine at 12\\r\\no\\'clock, but he had little comfort from that. At about 9 o\\'clock in the\\r\\nmorning he died. He was delicate and weak and could neither walk\\r\\nnor speak yet. We have had many difficulties with him; he was very\\r\\nsmall, and had a very weak chest so that he would never have been a\\r\\nstrong fellow. He reached the age of about three years. This is the first&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"43\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;of my children to be taken, and I\\'d not imagined that it could be so\\r\\nupsetting. My wife is also depressed over the loss of her child whom\\r\\nshe has nursed from her breast for nearly three years. But it is our\\r\\nhope that the Lord will support both of us in the way which He has\\r\\nled us.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D024\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDescribing changes which had occurred by 1855, Dunnink wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Land here is getting expensive. It has already changed hands\\r\\ntwo or three times and costs from $6 to $10 per acre &amp;mdash; and that for\\r\\nwoodland where the trees stand one next to the other. Winter is late\\r\\nthis year and without snow our work progresses nicely. The cows\\r\\ngraze in the woods and deer hunters are also all around. This fall the\\r\\nroads were very muddy so that many people are anxious for frost and\\r\\nsnow in order to bring their products to market with sleds, because it\\r\\nis frequently impossible to travel with wagons. Also we have\\r\\npurchased a new stove for $20. The old one was no longer reliable &amp;mdash;\\r\\nyes, a stove is worn out here in six or seven years. Many houses are\\r\\nbeing built in our neighborhood (Beaverdam), and many new houses\\r\\nwill soon be standing on the road to Zeeland. Some were built this\\r\\nsummer, and the people who plan to live here are cutting trees in the\\r\\nwoods. There is also a very large church here in Zeeland, with a\\r\\nmembership of at least 400 souls. The building is already too small\\r\\nbecause 30 or 40 people can\\'t find a place to sit on Sundays.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAs immigrants continued to settle in western Michigan, the original\\r\\nvillages of the colony, such as Drenthe and Vriesland, filled up. Already in\\r\\nthe 1870s new arrivals were forced to find land on the fringes of the colony.\\r\\nThus Blendon, located twelve miles north of Zeeland, became the home of\\r\\nthe Avink brothers. There they undertook the arduous task of clearing land\\r\\nand accumulating farm machinery and livestock.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHarm Avink remained in Blendon until 1906. Because he was not a\\r\\nwealthy immigrant, his oldest daughter worked among neighboring farmers\\r\\nas a housemaid for $2.75 per week. Later, she married a factory worker, who\\r\\nAvink claimed earned high wages in a Grand Rapids railroad yard. In 1889\\r\\nAvink was able to increase the size of his farm, but again he faced the back-breaking\\r\\ntask of cutting trees and grubbing stumps. Finally, in 1901, he\\r\\nreported that farming had become much easier since the stumps and roots\\r\\nhad been removed. By then he had also joined a marketing cooperative and\\r\\nwas earning $200 annually for his dairy products. He sold his potato crop in\\r\\nGrand Rapids and noted that pickles and sugar beets could be sold in\\r\\nHolland, where factories to process these crops had been established.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAvink\\'s life, however, was no broad path from pauper to large\\r\\nlandholder. That he did not acquire a larger tract of land was not because he\\r\\nwas disinterested. In his letters Avink continually reported the prices of\\r\\navailable land and lamented their constant increase. He simply could not\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"44\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I15.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\nafford to provide for his sons. It appears that one of his sons did become a\\r\\nfarmer, but for the most part his children found work in the city. Avink\\r\\nseemed pleased to report their success as factory workers.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWhen his friend in Bargem asked about the prospects for immigrants\\r\\nin Blendon, Avink advised him to consider South Dakota. Blendon was\\r\\nalready overcrowded in 1889, and the land was too expensive. A livable\\r\\nforty-acre farm was selling for two thousand dollars and at least another five\\r\\nhundred was needed to equip it. \"Many people,\" he wrote, \"were moving to\\r\\nSouth Dakota where there was an abundance of good land and few people.\"\\r\\nBut most importantly, the land there \"cost almost nothing.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt would be fair to say that Avink was marginally successful. He was\\r\\nable to spend his own days engaged in his chosen work, and at least one of\\r\\nhis sons followed his example. The objectives of his other children are\\r\\nunknown. Perhaps they preferred living in the city. Whatever their\\r\\npreferences, these children were able to find work close to the family\\r\\nhomestead. They selected mates of their own nationality and remained loyal\\r\\nto the churches of the extended ethnic community. Many of the Avink\\r\\ndescendants chose this comfortable pattern: today at least fourteen families\\r\\nbearing that name continue to live in the Grand Rapids metropolitan area.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt should be emphasized that the Avinks were not exceptional in\\r\\nmigrating to urban communities. The Dutch-Americans had never confined\\r\\ntheir residences to Van Raalte\\'s colony and its rural satellites. Poverty and\\r\\nthe early struggles for survival forced the immigrants to scatter, and the\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"45\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I16.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\nyoung people frequently worked in neighboring \"American\" towns and\\r\\ncities. Others joined Michigan\\'s lumberjacks in their winter camps or hired\\r\\nout to \"Yankee\" farmers. Before long these immigrant laborers formed urban\\r\\nclusters in Kalamazoo, Grand Haven, Muskegon, and Grand Rapids.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe initial lure in all those cities was economic; and when urban\\r\\nimmigrants prospered, they encouraged both their rural acquaintances and\\r\\ntheir friends in the Netherlands to join them. Furthermore, the opportunity\\r\\nto acquire inexpensive agricultural land in the colony decreased during the\\r\\nseventies and eighties. Consequently, both newly arrived immigrants and\\r\\nthe children of the initial settlers were motivated to seek livelihoods outside\\r\\nof the colony. Klass Ridder described these altered circumstances in letters\\r\\nto his family in Staphorst: \"Presently there is no demand for farmhands here\\r\\n[in Drenthe, Michigan].\" He declared, \"There are too many farmhands\\r\\nhere, and they can hardly find places to work. The farmers have too much\\r\\nmachinery, and the hired hands can no longer earn one dollar per\\r\\nday.... Land is increasingly more expensive, and many Dutch people are\\r\\ngoing West to the Dakotas and Iowa, where much more land is available at\\r\\nlower prices than here in the colony.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D025\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;The Lure of Urban Life&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nStructured by its factories, skilled trades, and businesses, urban life\\r\\nconditioned the immigrant\\'s behavior and perspective. Because a majority of\\r\\nthem found their first employment in factories, the newcomers described the\\r\\nchallenge of urban survival by reporting their daily wage, housing expenses,\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"46\"&gt;\\r\\nand grocery bills, rather than the cost of land and livestock.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlready before the Civil War, Grand Rapids, Muskegon, and other\\r\\nnearby cities contained clusters of Dutch-Americans. Grand Rapids\\r\\nattracted the largest number of immigrants (about two thousand Dutch\\r\\ninhabitants by 1860), but each of the other cities also housed several\\r\\nhundred Dutch residents. During the period of rapid industrialization that\\r\\nfollowed the Civil War, these ethnic enclaves grew steadily.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe experience of Henry Kroes in Muskegon illustrates the precarious\\r\\neconomic situation which confronted factory workers during the 1890s:\\r\\nFrom Ferwerd, Friesland, where diminished economic activity in 1891\\r\\nprovided Kroes with only intermittent employment, he and his wife, Altje\\r\\nBouma, immigrated to Muskegon, Michigan. Altje\\'s parents had preceded\\r\\ntheir daughter and son-in-law to that region during a more flourishing era,\\r\\nand the Boumas\\' letters had primed Kores to expect \"plenty to eat, plenty of\\r\\nmoney, and plenty of work for everyone.\" But Kroes arrived just as the high\\r\\ntide of Muskegon\\'s lumber era had begun to ebb, and many of its sawmills\\r\\nwere idle. Thus, the newly arrived young couple was forced to live with the\\r\\nBouma family while looking for employment.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D026\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nOf his troubled first years in Muskegon, Henry Kroes reported:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Soon after our arrival in America, we joined the First\\r\\nChristian Reformed Church on Terrace Street. Rev&amp;dot; Fles recognized\\r\\nus and asked us how we were and how we liked the new country. We\\r\\ntold him quite well, but that we couldn\\'t find any work. In a very\\r\\nquiet, undisturbed tone, he assured us that everything would be all\\r\\nright if we only had a little patience. But, of course, this good advice\\r\\ndidn\\'t help us much. After about three more weeks of walking from\\r\\nplace to place and asking as best we could for work, we were\\r\\nfortunate in securing a job at the Rolling Mill in Lakeside. A new\\r\\nbuilding was to be erected, and we had to shovel the loose sand away\\r\\nso the foundation of the building could be put on hard sand.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;During the first year we spent in America, Muskegon Heights\\r\\ncame into being, and as I passed a small planing mill located there at\\r\\nthat time, a man came out of the mill and asked me if I wanted to\\r\\nwork. As I was out looking for work, this appealed to me, and I was\\r\\nnever particular as to what kind of work I was expected to do. I\\r\\nworked at whatever I was told to do, as long as I was paid for doing\\r\\nit, because we were really in need of some money. Like all my other\\r\\njobs, this one turned out to be a hard one. This mill was moving to\\r\\ntheir new location in Muskegon Heights, and it was my job to load\\r\\nthe wagons with heavy sacks of cement, logs, machinery, and so on. I\\r\\nworked for four days, ten hours per day, and when everything was\\r\\nmoved and the work was all done, I received four dollars. This was\\r\\nten cents an hour for hard work, and this was the cheapest I ever\\r\\nworked in America.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"47\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I17.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"48\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;After this job, I started walking the streets once more hoping\\r\\nfor something else to turn up. Thayer Lumber Company had two saw\\r\\nmills at the foot of Fourth Street and a large lumber company. While\\r\\npassing the lumberyard I stopped to ask for work, and was hired to\\r\\nwork piling lumber. This was the best job I had had up until then, but\\r\\nafter a few days there, a man came up from the mill who needed a\\r\\nman to help there. I, being the newest man on the job, was sent with\\r\\nhim to the mill. I could not understand anything that was said to me,\\r\\nbut, by sign language, I was given to understand to follow him.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;He took me to a place which I afterward learned was the slab\\r\\nhole. The bark and the sides of the log were cut into slabs for burning\\r\\nwood and dumped into this hole, wagonloads at a time, and I was\\r\\nexpected to pile it up or throw it out of the way so the next wagonload\\r\\ncould dump. Also I had to watch out continually for the slabs that\\r\\nwere coming down the chute, so as not to get hit on the head or\\r\\nshoulders. But even by watching, it was impossible to avoid being hit.\\r\\nLumber was cheap in those days, and much of it was burned or\\r\\nwasted. Common sheeting lumber sold for $7 per 1000 feet.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The first day in the slab hole, I nearly worked myself to death\\r\\ntrying to keep up, and I was so tired at night that I could hardly walk\\r\\nhome. I was telling another employee whom I was walking with about\\r\\nmy experience that day, and he told me not to work so hard. He said\\r\\nto let the hole get full so that they cannot chute any more slabs into it\\r\\nand they\\'ll give me some help. This sounded like good advice. He also\\r\\ntold me that if the boss came and told me to hurry up, I should say,\\r\\n\"I\\'m doing the best I can.\" I said this sentence over and over to be\\r\\nsure I\\'d remember it. The next morning I went to work in the slab\\r\\nhole but worked much slower, and it wasn\\'t long before the chute was\\r\\nblocked. Soon the boss came swearing and cursing, but I merely said\\r\\nwhat I had learned the previous evening. \"I do the best I can,\" and it\\r\\nwasn\\'t very long before another man came to help me; and this was\\r\\nmuch better.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;During this summer our first baby was born. It was a girl and\\r\\nwe named her Tena. She was born August 1st&amp;dot; My work still was\\r\\nvery uncertain, a few days here and few days there, but the Lord took\\r\\ncare of us, and we always had enough to eat. And, of course, it\\r\\ndidn\\'t take much to feed our small family.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;During our first winter here and the following summer, working\\r\\nconditions did not improve. We still owed the $64 which my wife\\'s\\r\\nfolks had borrowed for us, and this had to be paid. Early in the fall of\\r\\nour second year here, Sypke Steensma, Sjoord Fennema, and Jan\\r\\nBroersma all moved to Grand Rapids, having heard that work was\\r\\nmore plentiful there, but we decided to stay in Muskegon.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;On a certain Sunday evening in the late fall of 1892, Albert\\r\\nBosch came to our house and asked me if I would go to Grand&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"49\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Haven with him in the morning. He had to go on to North Holland,\\r\\nbut told me if I went with him I could visit with Rev&amp;dot; K&amp;dot; Kuiper who\\r\\nhad been our pastor for seven years in Ferwerd. He had recently\\r\\nmoved to Grand Haven, having been called by the First Christian\\r\\nReformed Church there. Also I had catechism, and had been under\\r\\nhis influence and teaching and had learned to know and like him. In\\r\\nfact, my brother and I always addressed him as Father Kuiper, and I\\r\\nhad a great longing to see him again. So, I decided to make the trip to\\r\\nGrand Haven. However, not having any money to spend for train\\r\\nfare, we had to walk. Upon arriving in Grand Haven at the\\r\\nminister\\'s home, we were heartily welcomed, and I soon felt that he\\r\\nwould like to have us stay in Grand Haven. The following day the\\r\\nminister and I started out looking for work. We called at the corn\\r\\nplanter factory and one or two other places, but without much\\r\\nsuccess. However, the Reverend persuaded me to stay over for the\\r\\nnight, saying we would try again in the morning. That night the\\r\\ndeacons of the church came to the minister\\'s house to count the\\r\\ncollection taken in church the previous Sunday.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Among the deacons was a certain Jacob Dykstra, also a native\\r\\nof Friesland, and he also offered to assist in finding a job for me the\\r\\nnext morning. I accepted this kind offer. So the next morning,\\r\\nDykstra and I started out to look for work. He took me to the\\r\\ntannery and asked a Mr&amp;dot; Nyland, who was then the owner, for work\\r\\nfor me. Mr&amp;dot; Nyland had nothing just then, but he expected to have a&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I18.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"50\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;job in a month or two and promised to tell Dykstra, who, in turn,\\r\\nwould notify me. In January, 1893, I received a letter from Dykstra\\r\\ntelling me I could come to work in Grand Haven. I decided to go to\\r\\nGrand Haven alone, leaving mother and the baby in Muskegon until\\r\\nI could find a place for all of us to live.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;After a couple of weeks, I decided to look for a place to live\\r\\nwhere my wife and baby could stay with me. I finally found an old\\r\\nabandoned house on Pennoyer Ave. It was hardly liveable, having no\\r\\ndoors and broken windows. But the rent was cheap, so we moved in.\\r\\nI found a man in Grand Haven who had a team of horses and a\\r\\nsleigh. He offered to move our furniture from Muskegon. I was to\\r\\nhelp him, so we started in the morning and arrived in Muskegon\\r\\naround noon. We loaded what little furniture we had accumulated\\r\\nduring our stay in Muskegon and started back for Grand Haven.\\r\\nThis was in the month of February, and it was cold and dark when\\r\\nwe finally got back to Grand Haven. Mother and the baby arrived the\\r\\nnext day by train. We didn\\'t live in this house long before we were\\r\\noffered a much better house, whose owner, an old man, lived\\r\\nupstairs. This was old man Joldersma. Here, too, our living quarters\\r\\nwere very unpleasant.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;While living here, we had a peculiar experience, and we could\\r\\nsee the hand of God leading us along. While working one day, I cut\\r\\nmy hand, and it developed into a severe case of blood poisoning. We\\r\\nhad a grocer who called regularly for the grocery order, but when he\\r\\nnoticed that I was not working, he was afraid we wouldn\\'t be able to\\r\\npay for the groceries we ordered and refused to come. Being perfect\\r\\nstrangers with no money, we didn\\'t know what to do; but God, who\\r\\nsees all things, knew our circumstances, and he laid upon our friend\\r\\nDykstra\\'s heart to undertake for us once more without any effort on\\r\\nour part. He went around and found another grocer who agreed to\\r\\nfurnish us with our daily needs. The grocer\\'s name was Teese, and\\r\\nsoon after this I returned to work.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The longer we were in Grand Haven, the more acquaintances\\r\\nwe acquired, and among these was an old man, Pete Van Druinen,\\r\\nwho told us he had a house for rent on Pennoyer Ave&amp;dot;, close to where\\r\\nwe had formerly lived. We moved in here, and this was by far the best\\r\\nhouse we had lived in since coming to Grand Haven. This was in the\\r\\nspring of 1893, and the house cost us $3 per month.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I only worked [until 1896] at the tannery, and then this factory\\r\\nwent bankrupt. Times were hard, but I was fortunate in getting a job\\r\\nat the Brass Foundry as a buffer and polisher. This work was entirely\\r\\nnew to me and so different from what I had been accustomed to, that\\r\\nI found the days extremely long and tiresome. To make matters\\r\\nworse, I contracted rheumatism in my left leg. My job required that I\\r\\nstand up at the buffing wheel, and this I could hardly do without&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"51\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;suffering tremendous pain. Every day I hoped the pain would leave on\\r\\nthe morrow, and again and again I would go to the doctor, hardly\\r\\nbeing able to walk home after one of his treatments. At the Brass\\r\\nFoundry, we had only piece work, and I had to work hard to make\\r\\n$1.25 per day. These were the darkest days during our stay in Grand\\r\\nHaven.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;About this time the tannery was sold to a new owner, and he\\r\\nstarted operating it again. As soon as I heard about this I applied for\\r\\nmy former job and it was given to me again. So now I was once more\\r\\nfishing wet and slimy bark and hides out of the large vats. We wore\\r\\nrubber boots to keep our legs and feet dry, but these boots wore out,\\r\\nand there was never any money left over to buy new boots, so that I\\r\\nalways had wet feet and legs. Soon I was bothered with rheumatism\\r\\nagain, and on the advice of the doctor we decided to quit the tannery\\r\\nand move back to Muskegon. This was in the summer of 1901. A\\r\\nnew problem arose. In disposing of the house, we were eager to get as\\r\\nmuch money as we could out of it, but the house was hard to sell.\\r\\nFinally we found someone who paid us what we had invested, which\\r\\nwas not much, and he also paid the unpaid balance. So we left\\r\\nGrand Haven with our five children. We found a house on Hamburg\\r\\nStreet between Pine and Spring Streets. Here we had to pay five\\r\\ndollars per month rent.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nH&amp;dot; Kroes\\'s migrations between Muskegon and Grand Haven illustrate\\r\\nsome of the characteristics that defined the Dutch-Americans\\' urban\\r\\nenclave. In each of his migrations, for example, Kroes sought out the local\\r\\npastor, who provided assistance in finding housing and employment.\\r\\nFurther, the contacts which led to employment were generally discovered\\r\\nwithin the ethnic community, and when sickness impoverished his family,\\r\\nKroes acquired food, credit, and financial support from the church and its\\r\\nmembers. That Kroes did not migrate to Grand Rapids for work probably\\r\\nstemmed from his immediate family attachments and his loyalty to the\\r\\nchurch which had come to his aid.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nTogether, then, the local congregation and familial ties bound Kroes\\r\\nto a region in which his economic prospects were unsure. Several of his\\r\\nacquaintances (Steensma, Fennema, and Broersma) did migrate to Grand\\r\\nRapids, a city that provided a wider range of economic opportunity than\\r\\nMuskegon and Grand Haven. The \"Furniture City\" also contained west\\r\\nMichigan\\'s largest concentration of Dutch-Americans, together with a full\\r\\nspectrum of their social conventions and institutions such as churches,\\r\\nschools, and small businesses. One publicist claimed that by the 1920s only\\r\\nfifteen cities in the Netherlands contained larger numbers of Dutchspeaking\\r\\npeople than Grand Rapids.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D027\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Grand Rapids: The Urban Capital of Dutch-America&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlready during the 1870s Grand Rapids provided many occupational\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"52\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I19.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\nalternatives for Dutch immigrants in western Michigan, and it soon\\r\\nsurpassed Van Raalte\\'s colony as the urban center for Holland-Americans. A\\r\\nReformed Church had been organized in Grand Rapids even before Van\\r\\nRaalte established his colony. But since this congregation used the English\\r\\nlanguage, the new immigrants found little comfort in its ministry. Still, the\\r\\nbond of common ecclesiastical origins fostered immediate cooperation\\r\\nbetween the immigrants and their American countrymen. In 1849 the\\r\\nEnglish-speaking church offered its sanctuary to the new arrivals without\\r\\ncharge. One year later the immigrants organized their own church, and by\\r\\n1875 it had spawned two additional congregations. Meanwhile another\\r\\nimmigrant denomination had also been organized in Grand Rapids.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis astounding rate of church organization was related directly to\\r\\nemployment opportunities in Grand Rapids. Jacob Dunnink wrote, \"My\\r\\ndaughter Geertje has married a Zeelander and they have built a new house\\r\\nin Grand Rapids. He earns $1 per day. If they remain healthy, they will\\r\\nmake a good living. There is a large Dutch congregation with a minister\\r\\nfrom Zeeland in Grand Rapids.\" Dunnink\\'s daughter had worked in Grand\\r\\nRapids as a domestic servant and probably met her husband there. It was\\r\\ncommon practice for unmarried Dutch girls from the colony to work among\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"53\"&gt;\\r\\nthe wealthier people in Grand Rapids. Already in 1848 there were over 100\\r\\nDutch girls providing domestic service in Grand Rapids. Thus information\\r\\nabout job opportunities in Grand Rapids was readily available in the colony\\r\\nand, through correspondence, news about the situation in Grand Rapids\\r\\nreached the Netherlands regularly.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMost importantly, Grand Rapids offered the Dutch immigrants those\\r\\namenities which have always been necessary to attract them in large\\r\\nnumbers: a church with theological patterns drawn from the Netherlands,\\r\\nan opportunity to work and provide for their future, and a sufficiently large\\r\\nethnic community to produce husbands and wives for their children. Where\\r\\nthese ingredients have been present, the Dutch-American community has\\r\\nremained solid, and Americanization has not overwhelmed it.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D028\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nEvert Wonnink, who so narrowly escaped disaster on his ocean\\r\\nvoyage, gave vibrant expression to his satisfaction with Grand Rapids.\\r\\nHaving lost all their baggage, the Wonninks entered the city with little\\r\\nmore than the clothes on their backs, but friends were waiting for them and\\r\\nquickly provided meals and transportation. Even more surprising, a friend\\r\\nnamed Anton Hannink had rented a house for them with furniture and an\\r\\ninitial supply of foodstuffs. The Wonninks found work at a paper mill in the\\r\\nnearby village of Rockford, but as soon as possible they relocated in Grand\\r\\nRapids, which they liked better, \"because,\" he wrote, \"we can now go to the\\r\\nchurch and Sunday School regularly which we could not do when Herman\\r\\nand I worked at the paper mill because it was too far from the church.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThen assessing his first half-year\\'s experience, Wonnink wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;America is a good land for a laborer who wants to improve his\\r\\nlot by honorable labor with his hands. That has been written time and\\r\\nagain, and it is the truth. Even so, it is not right to urge people to\\r\\ncome. In some cases it appeared that those who came were not\\r\\nfollowing God\\'s will &amp;mdash; and many come here and find it totally\\r\\nunpleasant. As for us, from the first moment that we settled here, we\\r\\nfound it as good as in Holland.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWriting about a mutual acquaintance he said:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;You have asked about G&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Ter Winkel. He sends his greetings\\r\\nand adds that he is doing well. He lives near us, not further off than\\r\\nwe lived from each other in Holland. He has two daughters, and his\\r\\nwife was born in Groningen. He lives well. He works in the same\\r\\nfactory where Mannes and I work and he earns $1.50 per day. Thus\\r\\nyou can easily see that he lives well. Earlier he worked on his own,\\r\\ndigging wells and things, but this work was not steady and at that\\r\\ntime he did not live as well as now.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1873, Wonnink continued to report favorable impressions:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Our work is the same as before and we are clearly blessed. Our&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"54\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;city grows from year to year; this summer at least 600 new buildings\\r\\nwill rise. If you were here on Sunday, everything would be quiet. All\\r\\nthe shops, taverns, and inns are closed all day. The only exception is\\r\\nthe Pharmacy. If a saloon keeper should dare to open his saloon on\\r\\nSunday and is caught by the police, he is tossed in jail. If it is only the\\r\\nfirst time, he must pay a fine of $30. That is law and order. Now it\\r\\nis summer here &amp;mdash; good. This spring we had heavy rain and now warm\\r\\nsunshine. The crops grow more quickly here than by you &amp;mdash; and in\\r\\nfavorable weather people are often surprised by that. There are plans\\r\\nabout here to build another Holland church, because our church, built\\r\\nonly two years ago, is already too small to contain the worshipers.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D029\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNo sweeping generalizations can be constructed from Wonnink\\'s\\r\\nfavorable impressions.

Wonnink arrived in Grand\\r\\nRapids during a period of economic expansion which enhanced the\\r\\nprobabilities of his success. Others, writing during periods of economic\\r\\ncrisis, were less enthusiastic. In 1876, Jacobus Pietersen wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Times are very hard here in the United States.... It looks\\r\\nvery poorly for people with a family &amp;mdash; wages have dropped to $1 per\\r\\nday and thus many folk have little to look forward to. Sometimes I\\r\\nthink I will go back to the Netherlands, but I can\\'t yet make up my\\r\\nmind. I don\\'t know what is best. If I come back, the expense would\\r\\nbe very great. Good night! Sleep well.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nPietersen was unmarried, and the effects of the depression fell less\\r\\nheavily on him than on men with families. Thus he remained rather\\r\\nlighthearted about his circumstances. After he was laid off from his factory\\r\\njob, he acquired work as a farmhand twenty-five miles outside of Grand\\r\\nRapids. He had not yet seen the farmer, and explained, \"All this is by word\\r\\nof mouth, and if I don\\'t like what I see, I\\'ll just leave. This job is with the\\r\\nYankees &amp;mdash; &amp;lsquo;Yankees&amp;rsquo; is what we call the Americans here.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1884, during another period of economic crisis, S&amp;dot; Timmerman\\r\\nwrote, \"At the moment it is not very pleasant here. Times are hard. There\\r\\nare hundreds of men without work. We have not yet suffered from this but\\r\\nour wages are lower. I have worked in the factory for three years without\\r\\nunemployment. Thus it is a blessing that we can earn our own bread.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D030\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Grand Rapids: A Place for the Little People&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWhatever their individual disappointments and successes, Dutch\\r\\nimmigrants came to Grand Rapids in a steady stream. But the city attracted\\r\\nlaboring folk rather than the educated. As A&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Van Raalte explained to\\r\\nAbraham Kuyper in 1872, there was some need for schoolteachers among\\r\\nthe Dutch, but the great mass of immigrants would do best by seeking work\\r\\nin factories or as skilled workmen. An immigrant named J&amp;dot; Verweg had\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"55\"&gt;\\r\\ncome to Holland, Michigan, bearing a letter of recommendation from\\r\\nAbraham Kuyper. Van Raalte wrote Kuyper, \"I\\'m sorry if I have\\r\\ndisappointed you, but your recommendations do little good here, and my\\r\\nbroad recommendations are equally useless. Strenuous exertion is the only\\r\\nthing that counts here.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nVerweg, it seems, had hoped to find work in an office and expected\\r\\nwell-paid responsibilities, but he was disappointed. Van Raalte painted\\r\\nanother picture of the opportunities in Grand Rapids, \"where,\" he wrote,\\r\\n\"many Hollanders live in a fast-growing factory town. They use hand\\r\\nlaborers in the factory for making furniture, doors, and windows.... The\\r\\nskilled jobs pay the best and provide good prospects for those who will\\r\\nlearn.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nVan Raalte\\'s message differed little from that of ordinary laborers who\\r\\nsent letters to their friends and relatives. Their reports provided sufficient\\r\\nincentive to attract the common folk. Agnes Nestor described the coming\\r\\nof these new immigrants in her memoirs from the 1880s. \"We liked living\\r\\nnear the railroad depot,\" she wrote. \"We could see the trains arriving, and\\r\\nwhen there was a trainload of Dutch immigrants coming in, we would hurry\\r\\ndown to the depot. The newcomers still wore their native costumes and\\r\\ntheir clumping wooden shoes. They came to work in the Grand Rapids\\r\\nfurniture factories, and they brought along their families.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNestor correctly recognized that the Dutch tended to immigrate in\\r\\nfamily groups. But large numbers of unmarried immigrants also settled in\\r\\nwest Michigan. While family members could encourage each other in the\\r\\nface of loneliness and insecurity, single folk were more susceptible to social\\r\\nisolation and homesickness. Though their economic burdens were relatively\\r\\nlight, they frequently missed the supporting concern of their parents and\\r\\nsiblings. Some, like Jan Hofman, boarded with friends or in the homes of\\r\\nimmigrant families where they could recapture some aspects of family life.\\r\\nNonetheless, intimate family connections could only be maintained with\\r\\ncorrespondence.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D031\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nPleading with his brother, \"I hope you will write back directly. You\\r\\nwill, won\\'t you? Begin as soon as you receive this letter!\" Jan Hofman used\\r\\nnearly half of his November 9, 1909, letter to discuss the sending and\\r\\nmissending of letters. The dilemma that motivated his pleas concerned the\\r\\nmost serious decisions of his life. He had immigrated to Grand Rapids,\\r\\nwhere he found pleasant and profitable employment, but he had left his\\r\\nsweetheart in Groningen.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Your report about Geesje was hard for me to read. I don\\'t\\r\\nknow what to say, but I\\'ll need more time. I\\'ll write about it next\\r\\ntime. I love her, as you can plainly see, but I must also reckon with\\r\\nthe fact that a worker is far better off here than by you. Then too, she\\r\\ndoes not yet have permission to marry from her parents, and I will\\r\\ncertainly not force her against their will. Perhaps it would be best if&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"56\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;we ended our relationship &amp;mdash; even if that is hard for me.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;At the same time, I will not say that I will never come back to\\r\\nHolland. I hope I will. But even so, I don\\'t think she will come back\\r\\nwith me here &amp;mdash; and for me to begin working there again &amp;mdash; it is so\\r\\ncramped and lacking in opportunity &amp;mdash; especially after getting used to\\r\\nthis place. But you never know how things will turn out here. Men\\r\\nmake plans, but God decides, and that is for the best anyway.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nGeesje remained in Groningen and Jan stayed in Michigan, where his\\r\\nattachment to the opportunities that Grand Rapids provided dissolved his\\r\\nromance. His work in furniture factories, coal yards, and finally as a butcher\\r\\npaid well ($12 per week), and he urged his brother to join him. \"In all\\r\\nhonesty,\" he declared, \"it is much better here for a working man.\" Of\\r\\nGeesje he wrote nothing after 1909.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nStill, the Furniture City did not satisfy every immigrant. W&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; De\\r\\nLange\\'s lengthy account in 1873 includes a succinct if prejudicial sketch of\\r\\nthe city\\'s ethnic groups. \"The English,\" he wrote, \"are very wasteful, and\\r\\nmake a great deal of fuss, as is apparent from their political posters and\\r\\nannouncements &amp;mdash; sometimes they are as large as a house gable. The\\r\\nHollanders here are industrious and miserly. The Germans are crafty\\r\\ntradesmen. The Irish are lazy and good-for-nothing: thus it is not only the\\r\\nformer black slaves who are poor here.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe blacks, though, are very spirited and highly honored when you\\r\\ngreet them. The American\\'s idol is the woman &amp;mdash; to such an extent that even\\r\\nthe richest man would not think of asking his maid to polish his boots. The\\r\\nAmerican woman is lazy, proud, dirty, and wasteful. If you acquired one\\r\\nwith a $50,000 dowry, she would still be too expensive to keep.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D032\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThough he had no diploma, De Lange found employment as the\\r\\nDutch language teacher for the children of the Spring Street First Christian\\r\\nReformed Church. He lived in a downtown apartment and described the\\r\\ncity more generously than its people:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Grand Rapids is a city situated one-half on hills and the other\\r\\nhalf in a valley. It is larger than Amsterdam but not so cramped. It\\r\\nhas a population of 30,000 from all nations. It has 42 churches,\\r\\nsome of which cost $157,000. The Americans place a lot of value on\\r\\nworship. There are also many factories, large stores, and expensive\\r\\nbuildings, and many wooden houses which are well furnished. I live in\\r\\na second-floor apartment and pay $2 per week. It consists of two\\r\\nrooms, two windowless bedrooms, and many cupboards. It is located\\r\\nacross the street from my school.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThree months later, De Lange continued his description of Grand\\r\\nRapids:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We have already had (what seems like) three winters,\\r\\nsometimes so cold that you have to cover your whole head.

If I wanted to declare myself a doctor\\r\\ntomorrow, no one would prevent me. But whoever has the best proof\\r\\nof training has the best reputation. Teachers with diplomas are\\r\\ndifficult to find here.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDespite their excesses, De Lange\\'s observations contained considerable\\r\\ntruth. Grand Rapids did offer great economic potential for advancement;\\r\\nsubsequent developments within the immigrant community readily illustrate\\r\\nthis fact.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Marks of Success&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDutch immigrants have made Grand Rapids a center for the printing\\r\\nof religious and theological publications and one of the baking capitals of\\r\\nAmerica. The William B&amp;dot; Eerdmans Company, founded in 1910, was the\\r\\nfirst of three larger publishing companies which presently include\\r\\nZondervans and Baker Book House. And the Hekman Biscuit Company,\\r\\nwhich originated in 1893, has become one of the three largest baking\\r\\ncompanies in America.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"58\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nGrand Rapids has also become the administrative center of the\\r\\nChristian Reformed Church, which has founded a number of charitable and\\r\\neducational institutions throughout the United States. In Grand Rapids,\\r\\nCalvin College is the most prominent of these institutions. The college has\\r\\neducated thousands of the immigrants\\' children for a wide variety of\\r\\nprofessions.

Over the next\\r\\ndecade canals and railroads bound the city to a vast\\r\\nagricultural hinterland, and Chicago became a center for grain trade, meat\\r\\nprocessing, and the manufacture of agricultural machinery. Chicago also\\r\\nbecame the railroad transportation center of the Midwest, the place where\\r\\nGeorge Pullman organized a company to fabricate railroad cars. By 1870,\\r\\nthis Illinois city boasted a population of 300,000.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Two Settlements: The Low Prairie and the High Prairie&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe Dutch entered this area in 1846, when six families purchased a\\r\\nregion of land called the Low Prairie. Later, remembering their place of\\r\\nbirth, they dubbed the village South Holland.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1849 another cluster of Dutch families moved onto the open land\\r\\nsix miles closer to Chicago and named their settlement the High Prairie.\\r\\nAfter a time this area was called Roseland.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThese agricultural communities found ready markets in Chicago and\\r\\ntended to concentrate on garden farming. In a short time Dutch settlers\\r\\nbranched out to the southeast, occupying additional farmland in Oak Glen\\r\\nand Munster. By 1853 Dutch immigrants had claimed several thousand acres\\r\\nand had access to Ridge Road, a main artery to the Chicago markets. Over\\r\\nthe next forty years these original settlements spawned new Dutch-American\\r\\ncommunities in Highland, De Motte, and Wichert, all with\\r\\naccess to Chicago\\'s markets.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"60\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I21.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAmong these early agricultural settlements, Roseland was the first to\\r\\nbecome diversified. It all started when George Pullman constructed his\\r\\nrailroad car factory within easy reach of the Dutch settlement. The factory\\r\\nattracted a large work force, and property values rose rapidly. Land\\r\\npurchased at $5 per acre in 1849 sold for $2,000 per acre in 1880. At such\\r\\nprices farmers sold to subdividers and moved to less expensive lands\\r\\navailable among their countrymen in South Holland, Munster, and\\r\\nelsewhere.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMany of the immigrants who joined the Roseland community after\\r\\n1880 became urbanites, often finding employment in the factories of George\\r\\nPullman. But they remained Dutch: the Roseland-South Holland nexus\\r\\ncreated an urban-rural region in which Dutch-American institutions could\\r\\nflourish and expand. Farmers\\' sons, seeking release from the land, could find\\r\\nemployment and the ministrations of a Dutch church in Roseland as well as\\r\\nin the country.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;The Groninger\\'s Hoek&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThere was also a growing concentration of Dutch-Americans close to\\r\\nChicago\\'s center. That neighborhood, often called the \"Groninger\\'s Hoek,\"\\r\\ndates from 1848. The earliest settlers there, primarily from Groningen,\\r\\nfound profitable employment in Chicago. Peter Ritsma from Vierhuizen\\r\\nwrote that he and his brother were \"earning $18 per month. We pay $2 for\\r\\nboard and laundry so that each month we can save fl&amp;dot; 25, and besides have\\r\\nmoney for clothes, tobacco, and so forth. Jacob is working for a milkman\\r\\nand I am working for a brewer.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"61\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSince these immigrants had no Dutch church until 1858, they did not\\r\\ndemonstrate the same degree of ethnic unity evident in such communities\\r\\nas South Holland and Roseland. Rev&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Vander Meulen, the founder of the\\r\\nZeeland, Michigan, colony, served this Chicago church from 1858 to 1860;\\r\\nbut the church did not thrive until Rev&amp;dot; de Beij accepted their call in 1868.\\r\\nWithout his vigorous leadership this Dutch community in Chicago probably\\r\\nwould have become stagnant or ethnically mingled.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D034\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nLike his parishioners, de Beij had immigrated from Groningen, and he\\r\\nsoon became an ardent advocate of emigration to Chicago. By 1869 he was\\r\\nalready providing instructions to prospective emigrants. In the &lt;i&gt;Provincial\\r\\nGroninger Courant&lt;/i&gt; he suggested that immigrants could avoid complications\\r\\nafter arriving in New York by traveling on the Pennsylvania Central\\r\\nRailroad. Earlier travelers had complained that their trip to Chicago had\\r\\ntaken a whole week because of delays and false information. To avoid this,\\r\\nde Beij offered precise instructions:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;People should follow these instructions &amp;mdash; buy your tickets at the\\r\\nNew York office located at No&amp;dot; 8 Battery Place, and Pier No&amp;dot; 1,\\r\\nNorth River, which is just a few steps away from Castle Garden.\\r\\nThey will take particular care with your luggage. Immigrants will get\\r\\ntickets for their goods in Castle Garden and they will exchange these\\r\\ntickets for their luggage when they arrive at their destination. Every\\r\\npassenger is allowed 80 pounds (Dutch) of luggage without extra\\r\\ncost, and for those who buy tickets from the above-named office, their\\r\\nluggage will be picked up from Castle Garden and other places and be\\r\\ncarried to the railroad station without cost.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The passenger cars are well-ventilated, comfortable, and\\r\\nfurnished with water and lights. The passengers, or immigrants, will\\r\\nreach Chicago from New York in just 40 hours and their luggage will\\r\\nbe carried on the same train. Other destinations will be reached at the\\r\\nsame rate of speed, depending on the distance from New York.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The agent at the Pennsylvania Central Station is John\\r\\nMcDonald, No&amp;dot; 8 Battery Place and Pier No&amp;dot; 1, North River, New\\r\\nYork. It is my concern and interest in the welfare of my [countrymen]\\r\\nwhich has motivated me to search out this information, and people\\r\\ncan rest assured that the above information is accurate and they can\\r\\ndisregard whatever else they have heard.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nTwo years later de Beij wrote a detailed eye-witness account of the\\r\\nChicago Fire. He reported that among those people attending the three\\r\\nChicago Dutch churches, only two families had suffered losses. Of the\\r\\nNetherlanders attending English churches de Beij could make no accurate\\r\\nreport, but he estimated that no more than twenty Dutch families had been\\r\\nburned out by the fire. Despite the huge destruction caused by the fire, de\\r\\nBeij remained confident about Chicago\\'s future. He wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"62\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I22.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;There will be work and high wages in this city for years to\\r\\ncome &amp;mdash; even better than it has been before. Thousands upon\\r\\nthousands will be able to find work here in the future. If ever there\\r\\nwas a time when people could come to America with assurance that\\r\\nthey could improve their situation by working diligently (and this has\\r\\nalready been the case for many years), that time is now. But, just the\\r\\nsame, no one should imagine that he can get money without work &amp;mdash;\\r\\nand in most cases that work will be done with one\\'s hands.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nInfluenced by such encouragement, a large number of Groningers\\r\\nimmigrated to Chicago. Although a nucleus of these remained near the\\r\\ncenter of the city until the 1920s, many of the others moved southward in\\r\\nthe 1880s, organizing the Englewood neighborhood.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHenry Stob, professor of ethics, emeritus, at Calvin Seminary,\\r\\nremembers his boyhood in the old \"Groninger\\'s Hoek.\" It was, he recalls, a\\r\\ntightly knit colony of Netherlanders who spoke Dutch at home, worked\\r\\nhard, and harbored intense loyalties for their Dutch churches. His father\\r\\nhad attempted various occupations, including the cultivation of an eighty-acre\\r\\nfarm on Chicago\\'s western fringes. But, for most of his life Stob worked\\r\\nas a trash hauler or as the proprietor of his own feed and grain store. During\\r\\na three-year interval the Stobs attempted farming in a Dutch settlement in\\r\\nWinie, Texas, but they could not endure the hardships of alternating\\r\\ndrought and flood. Thereafter they returned to their former Chicago\\r\\nneighborhood, and moved, several years later, to Englewood to be near the\\r\\nChristian high school. In all these migrations the Stobs never deserted the\\r\\nsupporting comforts of the Dutch church and its members.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"63\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D035\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Moving to the Suburbs&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nToday few Dutch-Americans remain in their original urban\\r\\nneighborhoods. They have relocated in the suburbs. Often they were able to\\r\\nrelocate near the borders of the city, in places where farmer immigrants had\\r\\nalready constructed Dutch churches and Christian schools.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe village of South Holland readily illustrates this development. In\\r\\n1950 the town had 3,247 residents and included 85 farms. By 1960 the\\r\\npopulation had risen to 10,412 and the farms were reduced to 47. At the\\r\\nsame time, the number of major Dutch-American churches had increased\\r\\nfrom three to seven. Those farmers who wished to remain farmers had no\\r\\ndifficulty selling their land in South Holland for $2,000 to $3,000 per acre.\\r\\nWith such profits they could easily relocate in rural areas like De Motte,\\r\\nwhere, again, familiar Dutch-American institutions had preceded them.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThus, for over a century Dutch immigrants arriving in the Chicago\\r\\narea were able to select the occupations most suited to their skills and\\r\\nambitions while avoiding the harsher challenges of social novelty. As one\\r\\nimmigrant writing in 1853 said, \"Come to live with us here in [Roseland].\\r\\nHere we have freedom, equality, brotherhood &amp;mdash; these are no idle words.\\r\\nAnyone who wants to work and is able to do so can easily earn a\\r\\ncomfortable living &amp;mdash; can live peacefully and enjoy life.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D036\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAbout thirty years later, when Chicago had already grown into a large\\r\\ncity, U&amp;dot; V&amp;dot; L&amp;dot; Nywening provided a wide-ranging overview of the Roseland\\r\\ncommunity.

They could raise much more than they do. Still, there is no\\r\\npoverty here. Much of the crop goes to waste in the fields.\\r\\nConcerning potatoes, they harvest only the large ones and leave the\\r\\nrest to rot.... When they have enough, most Americans are lazy\\r\\nand indifferent about such waste.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Every day, long trains go past my house loaded with meat and\\r\\nbacon. The meat goes to New York, and from there much of it goes\\r\\nto Europe. But the poor people of Europe hardly see any of it, while\\r\\nhere, everyone eats as much as he wishes. So it should be easy for\\r\\nyou to understand that we enjoy life here.... With my two boys I\\r\\nearn $80 per month &amp;mdash; so you can well imagine that, if we remain\\r\\nhealthy, I will be a man of means in a few short years. Thus anyone\\r\\nwho despises my new fatherland is no friend of mine.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D037\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Roseland: Thorns or Roses?&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nOthers, however, found Roseland more than disappointing. Disputing\\r\\nreports of Roseland\\'s prosperity in the &lt;i&gt;Nieuw Advertentieblad&lt;/i&gt; of Friesland,\\r\\nWilliam De Jong concluded, \"You will seek vainly for roses in Roseland, but\\r\\nthey have thorns in abundance.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis debate about immigrant opportunities in Roseland had begun in\\r\\nFebruary, 1888, when De Jong had advised other Dutch families to remain\\r\\nin the Netherlands if they were doing well. He further suggested that the\\r\\nwinters in Roseland were unbearably cold and that employment in George\\r\\nPullman\\'s factory was poorly paid and difficult to acquire.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nReactions to these views appeared in two successive issues of the\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Advertentieblad.&lt;/i&gt; The first respondent, A&amp;dot; Van Ek, attempted to mute the\\r\\ncriticisms, arguing that although employment might not be available in the\\r\\nPullman works, ambitious people could always find employment elsewhere.\\r\\nHe further suggested that too many immigrants imagined America a land of\\r\\neasy success. Van Ek reserved his harshest attack for De Jong\\'s advice to\\r\\n\"remain where you are if you are doing well\":\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Why did you come to America? For no other reason than to\\r\\nimprove your lot &amp;mdash; right? Or did you have it good? If one does not&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"65\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;expect to improve his situation, then of course, no one would leave\\r\\nthe land of his birth. Thus, your advice, to stay where you are if you\\r\\nare well satisfied, is totally useless advice.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D038\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAnother correspondent, Wietze Posthumus, launched a bristling\\r\\ndefense of Roseland:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Perhaps thorns do grow on De Jong\\'s path in place of roses, but\\r\\nI have seen absolutely no poverty here unless as a consequence of\\r\\nsickness or from the misuse of liquor. I will not lie, you must work\\r\\nhard here, but you also get good wages &amp;mdash; everywhere people earn\\r\\n$1.50 for ten hours of ordinary work, whereas you must work a\\r\\nwhole week in Friesland for the same wages. I will not deny that there\\r\\nare many people here without work, but that is not always the fault of\\r\\nthe employer; more likely it is the fault of the employee. There are folk\\r\\nall over the world who would rather be idle, and America is certainly\\r\\nno place for talkers who do little. Everyone who wants to work and is\\r\\nable can find work easily here in America, even though it cannot\\r\\nalways be found in Roseland; for in the last few years there has been\\r\\nan excess of immigrants in the area.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;So I will contradict De Jong and say: Come to America,\\r\\nbecause you can earn your bread here and that is not always the case\\r\\nin Friesland.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D039\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDe Jong could not allow such assaults to go unanswered.

I can\\'t understand how Van\\r\\nEk can speak of saving when people earn $1.25 per day while one\\r\\nmust pay $12.00 per month for rent. Is that any kind of a life &amp;mdash; with\\r\\njust $.70 per day left over &amp;mdash; and then having to support a wife and\\r\\nchildren?\"&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBecause of this, De Jong claimed, \"There are many here who would\\r\\ngladly return to the Netherlands, but they cannot because of simple\\r\\npoverty.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis debate occurred during one of America\\'s economic crises, and in\\r\\nall probability De Jong\\'s advice, at that moment, was sounder than the\\r\\noptimistic suggestions of his antagonists. But over the years, Chicago &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\nprovided steady opportunities for immigrants of all sorts; and for those\\r\\nwilling to endure temporary setbacks, the prospect of social and economic\\r\\nadvance was solid.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D040\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;From Chicago to Texas and Back&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNonetheless, Dutch immigrants in Chicago retained an abiding\\r\\ninterest in rural opportunities. So it\\'s not surprising that speculators\\r\\nattempted to lure the urbanites with promises of inexpensive but fertile land\\r\\nin the far west. In 1894, for example, a committee of successful Dutch\\r\\nAmericans led by J&amp;dot; Broekema, a Chicago businessman, encouraged\\r\\nsettlement on land near Alvin, Texas.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"67\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I26.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nH&amp;dot; Koopman, an immigrant from Borger in Drenthe, who had found\\r\\nwork in Chicago as a gardener, was much intrigued by reports of Texas. He\\r\\nhad heard that in this agricultural paradise \"most crops can be raised twice a\\r\\nyear on the same land, even including potatoes.\" And, as he perceived it,\\r\\nhis own success was further insured by the fact that American farmers were\\r\\nlazy and careless. \"They till the soil poorly here,\" he wrote. \"All they do is\\r\\nplow the land, and they rummage around in the soil like pigs, and then they\\r\\nflatten it with a harrow. Most farmers in this country are lazy. They don\\'t\\r\\neven work for a third of the year.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nTempted by publicity, Koopman made the one-thousand-mile train\\r\\ntrip to Texas in 1898, but after observing the new colony, he returned to\\r\\nChicago, denouncing the whole venture as misguided. The promoters, he\\r\\nsaid, were worse than Judas Iscariot, for that betrayer had at least returned\\r\\nthe blood money. Koopman then exiled himself from all Dutch\\r\\nassociations &amp;mdash; the church, the Dutch consul, and the Dutch language\\r\\nnewspapers which had publicized the Texas venture.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nReporting his experience to a nephew in Borger, Koopman wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Two Dutch ministers sent many of their members to Texas\\r\\nwhere they had 5,000 acres belonging to a Holland organization.\\r\\nThey put out a booklet saying that it was a land flowing with milk\\r\\nand honey. Four Dutch ministers and a leading man in a large\\r\\nbusiness signed the booklet. I went to see Dominie Dykstra and asked\\r\\nhim many questions because he had seen the settlement and I was\\r\\ninterested in going there. So, I took the trip, but when I got to the last&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"68\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;stop on the railroad line, I had to stay overnight in a hotel: the\\r\\nsettlement was still twenty-five miles away, with no railway\\r\\nconnections.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;On the following day I started walking to the\\r\\nsettlement.... When I saw it, I said to them, \"The land is on a\\r\\nlevel with the sea (the Gulf of Mexico), and when the sea comes up\\r\\nyou will be flooded.\" They need steam plows to break up the land;\\r\\nthe people were killing themselves. I lived there for two days on\\r\\npancakes and coffee &amp;mdash; they had no bread and not one piece of meat,\\r\\nnot even beans. I went away hungry, found a hotel in Alvin where I\\r\\ngot a good dinner, and took the train back to Chicago.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nUpon returning to Chicago, Koopman visited Dominie Dykstra and\\r\\ndiscovered that the minister had never actually visited the colony, but had\\r\\ngone only as far as Alvin.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nKoopman reported:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Then the minister had to ask me what kind of place Liverpool\\r\\nwas and what I thought of it. I told him that it was poor for\\r\\nagriculture, and that with high water from the Gulf all would be\\r\\nflooded and that the people would be poverty-stricken and come back\\r\\nto Chicago. Within one year that is what happened. They were driven\\r\\noff by high water and they lost everything. They had to come back\\r\\nhome begging.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAfter that Koopman found work as a streetcar conductor, and,\\r\\nalthough isolated from the Dutch &lt;lacuna&gt; community, he continued to\\r\\nreport glowingly of Chicago and its opportunities. In 1920 he wrote, \"If you\\r\\nwere here in Chicago, your eyes would pop out.\" Koopman\\'s brother had\\r\\nwritten that their ancestral village in Drenthe was growing rapidly, but the\\r\\nnew Chicagoan was not much impressed:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Chicago has houses one next to the other from twenty to thirty\\r\\nstories high.... They have foundations thirty feet under the ground\\r\\nand they have entrances like the gates of cities. You must not compare\\r\\nstreets here to those in Holland. Here they are eighteen feet wide on\\r\\nboth sides, and four vehicles can easily pass each other. You can also\\r\\nsee the elevated train built on metal posts, and the trains fly past one\\r\\nanother to the west, south, and north. Lake Michigan is on the east\\r\\nside.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nKoopman never returned to the Dutch-American community, but he\\r\\nmaintained strong loyalties with his family in the Netherlands. After his\\r\\nretirement he wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I am in good health, and live in pleasant circumstances. I don\\'t\\r\\nwork any longer. I have a furnished apartment on the Boulevard, and\\r\\nI go where I wish for pleasure. If I were in the Netherlands, they&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"69\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;would tax me heavily because I am worth 30,000 guilders [i&amp;dot;e&amp;dot;,\\r\\n$15,000]. Now I would be most pleased if you would write to me\\r\\nand tell me who is still living and in what circumstances you find\\r\\nyourselves. I do not have much time left on the earth, and I do not\\r\\nwish to have my money divided among strangers when my time to die\\r\\ncomes. I would be pleased to have you or your children think of me\\r\\nafter my death, so I hope that you will write me quickly.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWith such incentives, Koopman\\'s Chicago address was probably\\r\\ncarefully preserved in Borger.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D041\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Klaas Niemeijer: A Typical Immigrant&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nKoopman\\'s experience in Chicago was not typical. Most Dutch\\r\\nimmigrants remained in their ethnic communities, finding comfort from\\r\\ntheir churches and pleasure in the company of their own people. Klaas\\r\\nNiemeijer, who immigrated in 1904, followed this more familiar pattern.\\r\\nThe Niemeijers traveled directly to Chicago, where they found temporary\\r\\nshelter with another Dutch family. Within four days they had rented an\\r\\napartment at seven dollars per month and Niemeijer had begun work as a\\r\\nteamster, hauling trash from Chicago at ten dollars per week.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe Niemeijers remained in the \"Groninger\\'s Hoek\" for six years,\\r\\nsettling into the community. Their children attended the Holland school,\\r\\nfor which Niemeijer paid $1.50 per month. The family attended the Dutch\\r\\nchurch, enjoyed sermons in their native tongue, and drank coffee with\\r\\nfellow parishioners after the services. They traveled to other Dutch\\r\\nneighborhoods in the city to meet acquaintances and friends from the\\r\\nNetherlands, and they read the Dutch-language newspaper, &lt;i&gt;Onze Toekomst,&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\nwhich informed them of events in the Netherlands as well as in America.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1907 Klaas Niemeijer was able to make a proud announcement. He\\r\\nhad become a farmer, the realization of a long-term objective. Before\\r\\ncoming to America Niemeijer had immigrated to Germany and had\\r\\naccumulated some capital by working in a coal mine. He had used that cash\\r\\nto establish a pig farm in the Netherlands, but disease had killed off his\\r\\nherd. With the balance of his money he bought passage to America. Thus,\\r\\nin 1907, when he finally achieved his goal, Klaas wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We no longer live in Chicago, but close by &amp;mdash; about three hours\\r\\nfrom the center of the city, or about twenty minutes from the city\\r\\nline.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We have rented 40 acres here for $130 annually &amp;mdash; that is 20\\r\\nacres of crop land, and 20 acres of pasture. A house comes with the\\r\\nfarm and it costs nothing extra. The streetcar is about five minutes\\r\\nfrom our door, and we take it to go to church, which is about a half\\r\\nhour away from us &amp;mdash; it is a Dutch church. Our children go to the\\r\\nEnglish school now which is about 10 rods (50 steps) off from our\\r\\nhouse. There are 10 or 11 Holland families here and we all rent our\\r\\nfarms.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"70\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;A German Jew lived here before us, and we bought from him\\r\\ntwo horses, a cow, and a wagon for $80. For $15 we bought hay,\\r\\nthree plows, a harrow, a sowing machine, but they are not worth\\r\\nmuch &amp;mdash; a pitch fork which is also worth little. Also ten chickens, and\\r\\nthen still more odds and ends. All of this we bought from the Jew,\\r\\nwho also lives in this house, and now he must move so we can move\\r\\nin. For all this we paid $550. Now we are farmers.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNiemeijer worked his garden farm for ten years, bringing crops to the\\r\\nChicago market two or three times each week. For fertilizer, he hauled free\\r\\nmanure from the Chicago stockyards. But, as the city grew to the west, his\\r\\nland was sold and Niemeijer turned to wholesaling. He bought celery from\\r\\nDutch farmers in western Michigan and transported it to Chicago for resale.\\r\\nDuring that period he moved back into the Dutch community on Chicago\\'s\\r\\nwest side. Finally, when he was too old to care for himself, Klaas lived with\\r\\nhis daughter in suburban Hinsdale, where she had married a farmer named\\r\\nSchooneveld.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1953, when Klaas was 88 years old, he proudly reported, \"I believe\\r\\nthat I have 30 grandchildren and 40 great-grandchildren, therefore quite a\\r\\ngroup.\" His children had scattered somewhat, but for the most part they\\r\\nlived nearby. One son, two hundred miles off, lived in Muskegon,\\r\\nMichigan, among other Dutch-Americans. Thus, there were no serious\\r\\nbreaches in the ethnic web.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNiemeijer\\'s life followed familiar patterns carved from the\\r\\nopportunities embedded in the character of the Dutch settlements of the\\r\\nChicago area. His personal history was duplicated by many others on both\\r\\nthe south and west sides of the city. These social-economic configurations,\\r\\nobviously similar to those in western Michigan, were also established by\\r\\nDutch-Americans in Wisconsin.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"71\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D042\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div2 name=\"Chapter 4 Settlements in Wisconsin\" type=\"chapter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;W&lt;/b&gt;isconsin, often called \"America\\'s Dairyland,\" is a famous\\r\\nproducer of dairy products, especially cheese. It has been\\r\\nestimated that, much like the Netherlands, the state contains\\r\\nabout one cow for every two persons. Long before this\\r\\ncharacteristic became evident, however, Wisconsin attracted the attention of\\r\\nprospective Dutch immigrants. H&amp;dot; P&amp;dot; Scholte was fleetingly drawn to\\r\\nWisconsin, and A&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Van Raalte had firm intentions of settling there.\\r\\nDissuaded from these plans by fears of adverse influences from the German\\r\\nCatholic populace which had gathered in Wisconsin, Van Raalte selected a\\r\\ntotally unsettled region in western Michigan. While others did not share\\r\\nVan Raalte\\'s fears, no leader of either Scholte\\'s or Van Raalte\\'s stature\\r\\nsettled in Wisconsin.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Why Not Michigan?&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nPeter Zonne, one of Scholte\\'s disciples, led a group of Zeelanders to\\r\\nWisconsin in 1847. Reports of sickness and hardship in Van Raalte\\'s\\r\\nHolland colony convinced Zonne to avoid Michigan and select an area near\\r\\nthe port of Sheboygan in Wisconsin. Several Dutch families had preceded\\r\\nhim to Wisconsin. One of these, the Peter Baden family, emigrated in 1844.\\r\\nExplaining why he did not settle in Michigan, Baden said:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Van Raalte\\'s colony is located in the state of Michigan. Many\\r\\nHollanders are located there, and it is a shame that he has put them\\r\\nin that place. The ministers there are even worse than they are in the\\r\\nNetherlands. They make laws upon laws to get money out of the\\r\\npeople\\'s pockets, but ordinary American laws are good enough for us.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"72\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I27.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"73\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We came here to be free, and not to be ruled by tyrants again. The\\r\\nministers only came here to get rich and to make servants of the\\r\\ninnocent and simple-minded Dutch immigrants. On top of all that\\r\\nMichigan is such an unhealthy land that many people die. People\\r\\nthere can never make much progress because they have to consume\\r\\neverything they raise. Thus there is no prosperity there. [A certain\\r\\nMr&amp;dot;] Baunt is also there, but he has written that he is coming here as\\r\\nsoon as the ice breaks, making the lake navigable. He will come to us\\r\\nhere in Wisconsin, but first he must sell his land. That is not easy\\r\\nbecause the ministers control the buying and selling of land in the\\r\\ncolony. If people make a profit from land sales, they have to turn it\\r\\nover to the ministers. That is a law passed by the ministers in\\r\\nHolland, Michigan, but it is not the law of the land.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D043\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Milwaukee: A Withered Transplant&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWithout ministerial leadership, a significant number of Dutch\\r\\nimmigrants had settled in the Milwaukee area. In 1851 Gijsbert van\\r\\nSteenwijk reported the presence of nearly eight hundred Dutch-Americans\\r\\nin that area. Van Steenwijk was well-educated and stood aloof from the\\r\\nDutch community that had begun to develop in Milwaukee. He described\\r\\nthem as \"poor and in many respects backward, but nonetheless honest and\\r\\nhardworking.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBy 1856 Dutch immigrants, occupying the northwest section of the\\r\\ncity, had created a neighborhood marked by solid homes and a church.\\r\\nJacob Quintus, editor of the Sheboygan &lt;i&gt;Nieuwsbode,&lt;/i&gt; wrote, \"They have seen\\r\\ntheir efforts crowned with excellent results. The miserable shanties in which\\r\\nthey have lived for a half dozen years have made way for excellent buildings,\\r\\nand still the Hollanders are forging ahead.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nObviously, an ethnic community of this sort with connected rural\\r\\nsettlements near the fringes of the city could have provided an ethnic\\r\\ncorridor for geographic mobility. In the Milwaukee area, however, the lure\\r\\nof the city surpassed that of the farm, and by the 1890s the nearby rural\\r\\ncommunities had been absorbed into the city. Ultimately the Dutch ethnic\\r\\ncommunity in Milwaukee disintegrated.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe history of Milwaukee\\'s Dutch community is clearly illustrated in\\r\\nthe experience of P&amp;dot; Lankester, who emigrated from Veere, Zeeland, in\\r\\n1849. Lankester settled in Franklin Prairie, fifteen miles outside of\\r\\nMilwaukee, and from the outset, he demonstrated an ambitious perception\\r\\nof Milwaukee\\'s economic opportunities. Although a baker, he was quick to\\r\\nrecognize other opportunities. In 1850 he noted that the city of Milwaukee\\r\\nhad no starch factory, although the ingredients needed to manufacture the\\r\\nproduct were available at low prices. Because he was not familiar with the\\r\\nmethods for making starch, he asked his brother in Veere to provide\\r\\ndetailed instructions explaining the starch-making procedures used in the\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"74\"&gt;\\r\\nNetherlands. Seventeen years later Lankester sought his brother\\'s assistance\\r\\nin acquiring the plans for a potato-peeling machine. Lankester\\'s housemaid,\\r\\na recent immigrant from Amsterdam, had reported that such a machine was\\r\\nbeing used in her native city. Lankester hoped to acquire a drawing of the\\r\\nmachine and intended to patent the invention in America, where, he\\r\\nwrote, \"Hand labor is too expensive to peel potatoes, and in general people\\r\\nare too lazy to peel them by hand, and thus unpeeled potatoes are served on\\r\\nthe tables.\" He did not expect to manufacture the machine, but rather to\\r\\nacquire an income from patent rights.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D044\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nLankester did not depend on such opportunistic ventures for his\\r\\nlivelihood. He diligently pursued his trade as a baker. From Franklin Prairie,\\r\\nwhere he lived on a farm and operated his bakery, Lankester made regular\\r\\ntrips to Milwaukee. Of his bakery he wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Bread is made (here) from the purest white flour, the finest\\r\\nkind you can buy at $4 a barrel.

Because if one thing doesn\\'t\\r\\nwork, people quickly turn to something else. Here there is not the\\r\\nleast difference between farmers, city dwellers, or gentlemen. People,\\r\\nfrom the poorest day laborer to the President, are addressed \"Mr&amp;dot;\"&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D047\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThroughout his correspondence between 1850 and 1867, Lankester\\r\\nfrequently advised prospective immigrants of the great opportunities for\\r\\ncarpenters, bricklayers, and other tradesmen in Milwaukee. And his own\\r\\nbusiness was probably not hindered by moving to the city. In any case,\\r\\nwhen Lankester and his neighbors deserted Franklin Prairie, the most viable\\r\\nopportunity for constructing a combined rural-urban ethnic complex in the\\r\\nMilwaukee area also disappeared. Commemorating fifty years of Dutch\\r\\nsettlement in Wisconsin, J&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; Karsten said:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;In spite of every economic and other advantage, Franklin\\r\\nPrairie never became a thriving Dutch settlement. The population\\r\\nsoon began to decrease and is still decreasing so that at the present\\r\\nmoment not more than twenty families remain. The settlement thus\\r\\nappears to be threatened by early extinction. One reason for this\\r\\ndecline is the lack of the consistent preaching of the gospel. Without\\r\\nthis advantage, the Dutch settler was not likely to be drawn to any\\r\\nsettlement.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I28.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"76\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe only other Dutch settlement near Milwaukee suffered a similar\\r\\nfate. Town Eight, or Bethlehem, organized in 1847, enjoyed the ministry of\\r\\nDominie H&amp;dot; Budding for a short time. Budding, who had first joined a small\\r\\ngroup of immigrants in Ravenna, Michigan, drifted from there to Town\\r\\nEight, and later to the east coast. Gerhardus Brandt became the lay pastor\\r\\nof the Town Eight congregation in 1854, with a salary of $100. But following\\r\\nthe death of his wife in 1856, Brandt married a young widow who owned a\\r\\n20-acre farm. Something about this development irritated the congregation,\\r\\nand Brandt gave up his ministerial duties to become a farmer. Perhaps the\\r\\ncongregation interpreted his marriage to a wealthy widow seventeen years\\r\\nyounger than himself as somewhat opportunistic.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSummarizing these events, G&amp;dot; Brandt\\'s daughter exclaimed, \"There\\r\\nare already many religious divisions among the Hollanders in America.\" At\\r\\nany rate, Town Eight, which numbered only thirty families in 1857, was\\r\\nunable to retain the services of G&amp;dot; Brandt and found no one to replace him.\\r\\nLater, when the open spaces around the village attracted non-Dutch\\r\\nsettlers, the Netherlanders drifted away.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D048\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Sheboygan: A Lasting Community&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDuring these same years another Dutch-American community had\\r\\ndeveloped in the Sheboygan area, fifty miles north of Milwaukee. That\\r\\ncommunity, which still exists today, shares characteristics with the Dutch-American\\r\\ncommunities of western Michigan and the Chicago area.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe first Dutch families who arrived in Sheboygan County (between\\r\\n1845 and 1847) were devoted farmers. After purchasing parcels of\\r\\nWisconsin\\'s virgin forest, they began to cut and haul the lumber to ports\\r\\nsuch as Sheboygan and Milwaukee. These cities provided markets for both\\r\\nthe lumber and the agricultural products that the settlers had begun to raise\\r\\namong the tree stumps. Most of these immigrants were poor and sought\\r\\nadditional work for cash. The city of Sheboygan, which had been settled by\\r\\n1834, offered some opportunities for day laborers; but it was little more than\\r\\na village and could not sustain so large a work force as Chicago or Grand\\r\\nRapids. Thus the Dutch-American community in Wisconsin did not extend\\r\\nmuch beyond Sheboygan County. Still, because Sheboygan provided\\r\\nemployment in mills and on the docks, the urban-rural pattern did develop\\r\\nthere. By the 1870s the town also acquired factories. So a number of\\r\\nimmigrants who worked in Milwaukee moved to Sheboygan. Others were\\r\\ndrawn from temporary employment in eastern cities such as Buffalo and\\r\\nRochester, New York.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWithin one decade Sheboygan County immigrants had established\\r\\nfour rural towns, and several families had also settled in the port city. The\\r\\nexperience of Graadus Heinen, who immigrated from Aalten in 1854, was\\r\\nprobably typical. He traveled directly to Sheboygan, where he found lodging\\r\\nwith his brother-in-law. Heinen began working immediately, claiming that\\r\\nhis salary for one day\\'s work equalled that of a whole week\\'s wage in the\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"77\"&gt;\\r\\nNetherlands. Food, and meat particularly, he declared, was so inexpensive\\r\\nthat \"we never lived better than this in the Netherlands.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nShortly after immigrating, Heinen rented an eighty-acre farm on a\\r\\nseven-year lease. Twenty acres of the land had been cleared, and he was\\r\\nable to pay his rent by selling lumber from the uncleared land. For extra\\r\\ncash he hired himself out to neighboring farmers. In one instance, Heinen\\r\\nreported, an American farmer paid him a dollar per day plus food and\\r\\nlodging. While there Heinen reported, \"I ate as good as the best citizen in\\r\\nAalten.\" Further, he enjoyed the service of a Dutch church and the\\r\\ncompany of his brother, Abraham, who lived a half hour\\'s distance away.\\r\\nHeinen proudly announced the purchase of milk cows, oxen, and farm\\r\\nmachinery. He asserted, \"We cannot thank the Lord enough for having sent\\r\\nus to North America, because we have a good and blessed life here.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D049\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHowever, by 1859 opportunities for penniless immigrants decreased.\\r\\nC&amp;dot; Snoeyenbosch, who had been a resident of Sheboygan County for twelve\\r\\nyears, offered detailed advice to a prospective immigrant in Winterswijk:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;You ask how things go here for someone who comes with little\\r\\nor no money. Dear nephew, for such people there is no prospect of\\r\\nowning land, especially if they must support a family, because the\\r\\nland which we bought 12 years ago for fl&amp;dot; 12 per acre costs fl&amp;dot; 57\\r\\ntoday.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;But, we don\\'t think it will be difficult for you. If you have a\\r\\nhealthy body, you can earn enough here to buy a small piece of&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I29.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"78\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I30.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;ground quickly. You can earn three times as much here as by you,\\r\\ndespite the fact that wages are presently low here.... In winter\\r\\nthere is little work here, but you can make wooden shoes.... They\\r\\nare made from linden wood which is easy to work and costs little or\\r\\nno money. It is true, it would be better if there were fewer wooden-shoe\\r\\nmakers here, but we have talked to our brother-in-law who has a\\r\\nstore which sells many wooden shoes. He will take them from you if\\r\\nthey are well made... but make sure that you take good tools\\r\\nalong, because they are not available here.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSnoeyenbosch offered hearty encouragement to his nephew, urging\\r\\nhim to come to Wisconsin. But for those who wished to become large\\r\\nindependent farmers, he had other advice. He suggested that they immigrate\\r\\nto Iowa, Minnesota, or other less-settled areas. Sheboygan County was\\r\\nalready beginning to fill up. In 1852, according to Dominie P&amp;dot; Zonne, it\\r\\nalready had two hundred farmsteads covering about six thousand acres. Jacob\\r\\nQuintus, editor of the &lt;i&gt;Sheboygan Nieuwsbode,&lt;/i&gt; reported a large influx of new\\r\\nimmigrants in the mid-50s&amp;dot; Land was still available in the Sheboygan area,\\r\\nbut the prices were rising rapidly. Thus, opportunities for the poorest\\r\\nimmigrants had begun to dwindle.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSnoeyenbosch\\'s advice &amp;mdash; to seek less-expensive land in the west &amp;mdash; was\\r\\nwell-founded. Many immigrants moved from Wisconsin, Michigan, and\\r\\nelsewhere to Minnesota and Iowa. From Iowa they trekked to South Dakota,\\r\\nNebraska, and Kansas. They were not merely content to provide for\\r\\nthemselves, but were also anxious to secure farms for their sons and\\r\\ngrandsons.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"79\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I31.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe search for fertile but inexpensive land continued until the turn of\\r\\nthe century. The immigrants\\' sons and grandsons, as well as new arrivals,\\r\\nwrote constantly about the cost and availability of farmland. Many were\\r\\nwilling to reestablish themselves when prospects seemed more attractive\\r\\nelsewhere, but they seldom set up housekeeping beyond the reach of other\\r\\nDutch-Americans and their churches. Roelof Brinks, who had immigrated\\r\\nfrom Emmen in 1853, moved to Orange City, Iowa, after working and\\r\\nfarming in Michigan for twenty-six years. In 1879 Brinks reported that he\\r\\nhad moved to Orange City because the land in Michigan was too expensive\\r\\nfor his children. And, he added, \"Iowa is all prairie, has no trees and is very\\r\\npleasant. The soil is very fertile. We have 240 acres and I have already sold\\r\\nmy land in Michigan.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nJohn Brinks, Roelof\\'s brother, had moved to Iowa eight years earlier.\\r\\nRoelof wrote, \"John has 120 acres which our children will inherit, because\\r\\nhe is unmarried and has no children.\" Then three years later Roelof offered\\r\\nadditional advice to his family in Drenthe, pointing them to a new\\r\\nsettlement 140 miles westward in South Dakota where \"you can get 160\\r\\nacres for almost nothing under the Homestead Laws. It is not yet populated,\\r\\nbut it looks like a good future for people who are willing to work.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThus the word was out. Land in the Great Plains states could provide\\r\\nhomes for the poorest immigrants. The drama could be reenacted.\\r\\nImmigrants who had temporarily settled in Michigan, Illinois, and\\r\\nWisconsin, together with a host of new arrivals, moved through Pella to\\r\\nwestern Iowa, South Dakota, and beyond.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"81\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D050\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div2 name=\"Chapter 5 Farming in the West\" type=\"chapter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;s the midwestern colonies became crowded, many immigrants\\r\\nlooked further west. Dutch immigrants joined their new\\r\\ncountrymen in a headlong rush for land whenever new regions\\r\\nbecame available. And as more immigrants flooded into the\\r\\ncountry, looking for fertile soil, the United States government, both by war\\r\\nand treaty, pushed the native Americans into undesirable areas. Between\\r\\n1850 and 1900 literally hundreds of immigrant villages dotted the western\\r\\nlandscape.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe treeless prairies and plains offered opportunities quite different\\r\\nfrom those in the woodlands of Michigan and Wisconsin. On the prairie\\r\\nimmigrants were able to cultivate their land immediately. Also, unlike the\\r\\nconstruction of log homes in the north, building sod houses required few\\r\\nspecial skills.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBut these prairie settlers also faced unique difficulties. Fuel was scarce;\\r\\nmany immigrants resorted to burning woven bundles of prairie grass or\\r\\nimported coal. Also, the weather was unpredictable: wind storms, carrying\\r\\nsnow or dust, brought extensive hardship and damage. And prairie fires,\\r\\nfanned by strong winds, caused frequent anxiety and occasional disaster.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDespite these difficulties, Netherlanders emigrated to the West\\r\\nregularly between 1847 and 1920. Other Dutch-Americans, lured from the\\r\\ncities and smaller farms of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Illinois, soon joined\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThese settlers established communities in which almost every activity\\r\\nsupported the needs of the farmer. Agriculture fosters relatively sparse\\r\\npatterns of population, especially when each farmer cultivates parcels\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"82\"&gt;\\r\\naveraging 160 acres or more. Thus, Dutch villages like Pella and Orange\\r\\nCity in Iowa never became thickly populated commercial centers. Trade\\r\\nroutes passed through these towns on the way to Chicago and St&amp;dot; Louis, but\\r\\nthe farmer\\'s convenience restricted the growth of the country village. To\\r\\nsucceed, the banks, mills, and churches of these places had to be located\\r\\nwithin convenient reach. Farmers located up to twelve miles from town\\r\\ncould make a round trip to the mill or blacksmith in one day with a horse\\r\\nand wagon. When settlers located beyond the twelve-mile range, towns\\r\\nwith churches and other institutions sprang up within the newly occupied\\r\\nregions. These forces scattered the Dutch-American community across the\\r\\nlandscape in small village-oriented concentrations.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Iowa: The Richest Soil&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1847 Pella became the first Dutch colony across the Mississippi\\r\\nRiver. Scholte and his followers selected that site for several reasons. First,\\r\\nand most important, they were convinced of its agricultural potential. But\\r\\nthey were also influenced by its location: the town was built on a road\\r\\nleading to markets in Keukuk. And it was near the Des Moines River,\\r\\nthought to be a potential trade route to St&amp;dot; Louis and the Mississippi River.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlthough the land lived up to their expectations, its location never\\r\\npaid off for these Netherlanders. They soon discovered that the distance\\r\\nbetween Pella and the markets of Keukuk &amp;mdash; approximately 120 miles &amp;mdash; was\\r\\ntoo far to make business there a realistic option. Also, attempts to improve\\r\\nand use the Des Moines River never succeeded. Pella remained an isolated\\r\\ncolony until railroads reached the area in 1866.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFrom its inception, Pella, with its treeless surroundings, provided an\\r\\nalternative to Van Raalte\\'s colony amid the Michigan forests. Settlers in\\r\\neach location sought information with which to compare the relative\\r\\nsuccess of the two settlements. Thus, in 1849 H&amp;dot; Van Eijk from Holland,\\r\\nMichigan, urged his friend H&amp;dot; Van Asselt to \"write about Rev&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; P&amp;dot; Scholte\\r\\nand his colony.\" For Van Eijk said, \"They do not speak well of it here. But I\\r\\nsincerely hope that these reports are all lies.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D051\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt is not evident that Van Asselt ever visited Pella, although it seems\\r\\nthat he immigrated with intentions of joining the Scholte venture. He and\\r\\nVan Eijk probably met during their travels from Europe and apparently were\\r\\nacquainted with another young man, G&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; Meyer, who &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; settle in Pella.\\r\\nBoth Van Asselt and Van Eijk had heard negative reports about Pella, and\\r\\nMeyer sought to correct these misrepresentations in an 1848 letter to Van\\r\\nAsselt:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I am pleased that you have asked me to report concerning our\\r\\ncolony because some people look down upon it. But they entirely\\r\\nmisrepresent Pella. Some people who moved back to St&amp;dot; Louis have\\r\\nmade themselves unworthy of Pella, and now, to justify having left,\\r\\nthey do nothing but belittle and slander our beloved servant of Jesus&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"83\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Christ, Rev&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; P&amp;dot; Scholte.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Now, friend, I will respond to your question. Carpenters have\\r\\na lot of work here, and they earn a dollar per day. Brickmasons earn\\r\\nthat same wage, but they have less work as there are not many bricks\\r\\nhere yet. There is not much work for painters because we have as yet\\r\\ntoo few nice houses. Work is beginning to improve for tailors, and it is\\r\\nalso good for shoemakers. There is much work here for the blacksmith\\r\\nand wheelmaker. Laborers earn fifty cents per day working from 7\\r\\nA&amp;dot;M&amp;dot; to 6 P&amp;dot;M&amp;dot; &amp;mdash; and work of all sorts is becoming more available.\\r\\nAt first there was not much work here, and even farmers had too\\r\\nlittle. One reason for that is because there is less wood to be cut here\\r\\nthan in other colonies. But, even though the prairies and farmlands\\r\\nare without forests, the countryside is beautiful. The roads are good\\r\\nenough for transportation, but we have not yet harvested a crop&lt;/i&gt;&lt;note ref=\"1\"&gt;1 &lt;i&gt;Meyer\\'s letter is dated June 20, 1848, and the Scholte group did not arrive in Pella until August\\r\\n1847.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt; &lt;i&gt;to\\r\\nuse them.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;If you had come here with us, you could have had a good job\\r\\nhelping a doctor, and then your trust in Scholte would not be\\r\\nshaken....

I want to tell you this: I have written only the truth, and I\\r\\naffirm again that it is reasonably favorable for all classes of people\\r\\nhere. And, when you consider how short a time we have been here,\\r\\nwe must be thankful for prayers answered beyond our expectations.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D052\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDuring the succeeding decades, Pella became an increasingly\\r\\nattractive and thriving community. An immigrant who visited Scholte\\'s\\r\\ncolony in 1887 wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Pella is a city of trees. Among the trees that adorn the city are\\r\\nmany fruit trees.... Pella and its environs is a land of corn and\\r\\nswine. The corn harvest is immense, and hogs are raised by the\\r\\nthousands. They are shipped live to Chicago where they are processed\\r\\nby the big meat packing companies. Herds of beef cattle are also sent\\r\\nto the market from Pella.... Farmers are proud of their cattle and\\r\\nconstantly seek to improve the breed. They even import cattle from\\r\\nFrance and Norway.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nLong before 1887, however, land prices near Pella had risen sharply,\\r\\nand newly arriving immigrants tended to bypass Scholte\\'s colony in favor of\\r\\nless-expensive land further west. Already in 1869 a group of Pella\\'s residents\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"84\"&gt;\\r\\ntraveled westward in search of unsettled land which could be acquired from\\r\\nthe government. They located rich soil in Sioux County near Iowa\\'s\\r\\nnorthwestern border. Sioux County was three hundred miles west of Pella, a\\r\\ndistance that effectively destroyed daily interrelationships between the new\\r\\ncolony and its parent. Thus, in 1870, when these settlers established\\r\\nOrange City, they quickly organized a church and the essential businesses\\r\\nconnected with agricultural activity.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis process was reenacted time and again during the nineteenth and\\r\\nearly twentieth centuries: more than one hundred similar Dutch colonies\\r\\nwere established across the Mississippi River. Westward they stretched to the\\r\\nPacific Ocean. From Texas they extended northward into Canada. Many of\\r\\nthese colonies failed, and none of them became large urban centers. But\\r\\nthose that succeeded survived as small rural communities serving an\\r\\nagricultural clientele.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D053\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nLand attracted these pioneers, vast stretches of unclaimed land that\\r\\ncould be acquired under the Homestead Laws enacted in 1862. Using this\\r\\nlegislation, a family could gain title to 160 acres by merely occupying and\\r\\ncultivating their holdings for five years. This opportunity came too late for\\r\\nthe founders of Pella, but Dutch settlers who moved into Sioux County took\\r\\nfull advantage of the Homestead Laws, acquiring 24,320 acres in 1869.\\r\\nDescribing that area as it appeared to him in 1872, E&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; G&amp;dot; Bloemendaal,\\r\\nwho immigrated from Gorssel, wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;When we stood on top of the low hills and viewed the area in\\r\\nthe region surrounding Orange City, the landscape was simply\\r\\nbewitching. The land was a rolling prairie with gradual inclines and\\r\\ndeclines rising and falling 40 or 50 feet over a quarter mile\\'s\\r\\ndistance.... The soil is so rich that it needs no fertilizer for the first\\r\\n20 years. It is neither clay nor sand. They call it muck. It is not\\r\\nheavy and can be worked easily with a team of horses. The soil is\\r\\ncomposed of decayed grass which has accumulated year after year for\\r\\ncenturies and is entirely unlike that found in Europe.

Soon the growing stream of\\r\\nDutch immigrants was forced to move to other parts of the county,\\r\\nestablishing additional towns. Sioux Center originated in 1871, Hospers in\\r\\n1873, Maurice in 1884, and Hull in 1895. In South Dakota, just over the\\r\\nBig Sioux River, additional Dutch settlements sprang up in the 1880s; while\\r\\nNebraska, another neighboring state, had already attracted settlers from\\r\\nWisconsin in 1870. Nearly all these settlements were located on railroad\\r\\nlines, and each acquired its own Dutch church and essential business\\r\\nestablishments. When fully grown, the most successful of these villages\\r\\noffered a substantial range of useful services.

But the path to independent\\r\\nmeans was neither direct nor assured. For those with substantial resources,\\r\\nSioux County provided the most favorable opportunities for success. The\\r\\nquality of its soil and a generally reliable rainfall produced opulent crops\\r\\nyear after year. So it\\'s not surprising that land values have risen continually\\r\\nin Sioux County since 1870. When H&amp;dot; Beltman emigrated to Orange City\\r\\nin 1878 and acquired 160 acres of land for about $10 per acre, he probably\\r\\nnever imagined that the same land would sell for $2,500 per acre in 1977.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D055\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe Beltmans began their new life in Orange City under the most\\r\\nfavorable circumstances. Writing to his family in Winterswijk, Beltman\\r\\nexclaimed:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The land which our brother bought for us impressed us very\\r\\nwell, with good crops nearly ripe. The crops were almost worth as\\r\\nmuch as the price of the land. But we have been very busy because\\r\\nthe crops were ready to harvest. When we first came, we had to finish\\r\\nthe harvest and then build a house &amp;mdash; now we have built a good house.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Now things are looking very good to us. We have bought an\\r\\nextra 80-acre piece of ground for good measure, and it has both a\\r\\nhouse and a stable which cost us $800. We have rented it to some\\r\\nGelderlanders for one year at a third of the crops. Then we have\\r\\nanother 80 acres next to our land which we will till ourselves. That\\r\\ncost $700 without a house or stable. That land is located next to the\\r\\nplace where we have built our house.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We have three work horses: two of six years that are black and\\r\\nanother of five years which is brown. They cost $100 each. We also\\r\\nhave a wagon for $88 and two cows &amp;mdash; one for $26 and one for $27.\\r\\nWe still have three pigs after butchering three others.

Arriving\\r\\nin well-established Dutch-American communities, they were able to\\r\\nparticipate comfortably in familiar social and religious institutions. Hull,\\r\\nIowa, a village much like Orange City, was founded in 1895, and A&amp;dot;\\r\\nBrunsting, who settled there sometime after 1890, described that area for his\\r\\nbrother in Beilen, Drenthe. He wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"87\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The land here is nicely arranged. Every farm has enough hay\\r\\nand pasture to feed its own livestock, and the balance of the land is in\\r\\ncultivation. Most farms are of about 160 acres, and those who have\\r\\nthe chance rent another 80 or 160 acres in order to keep a hired hand\\r\\nbusy. Those like us with 120 acres can work the land without extra\\r\\nhelp.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D056\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1909 Brunsting enlarged on that description:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We live two and a half miles from Hull, thus not very far off.\\r\\nSome live six, seven, or eight miles from the city which makes it a\\r\\nlittle difficult to attend church twice on Sunday.

In the last few\\r\\nyears land has become expensive here, so that it has increased in price\\r\\nby about 50 percent&amp;dot; Land near the city has already gone for $125\\r\\nper acre. Last year I bought 80 acres about five miles from the city\\r\\nfor $97 per acre. Now I\\'ll tell you a little about our farm as you\\r\\nasked. We work about 300 acres per year, that with two boys. But it\\r\\nis impossible to describe everything to you &amp;mdash; how the machinery and\\r\\neverything else works. I hope sometime to be able to tell you in\\r\\nperson.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D057\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAmong large farmers like Brunsting, new immigrants could readily\\r\\nacquire positions as hired hands or housemaids. Their wages were relatively\\r\\nhigh, and they were able to accumulate capital for the eventual purchase of\\r\\ntheir own land and equipment. Herman Berghuis, for example, immigrated\\r\\nto Orange City, Iowa, in 1882. There he worked for B&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Grooters, who had\\r\\nimmigrated in 1866. Berghuis contracted for eight months\\' work at $70 with\\r\\nroom and board, and, since he was inexperienced, he considered himself\\r\\nwell-paid. Of his prospects he wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;It is such here that people can progress better than in the\\r\\nNetherlands if they will work and if they enjoy the Lord\\'s blessing.\\r\\nAlso many people are going to Dakota, where you can get 160 acres\\r\\nfor $23. The land there is as fertile as here. The farmers have it much\\r\\nbetter here than by you and also the hired hands; thus one can\\r\\nbecome a farmer quickly here. If you have two horses, a plow, a\\r\\nwagon, a cultivator, and a mowing machine, you are ready to farm.\\r\\nIf I work here for two years, I will have more than if I worked for five\\r\\nyears in Holland. Every day we eat white bread with the boss &amp;mdash; and\\r\\nthat tastes good.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D058\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAnother young farm hand, G&amp;dot; van Nijhuis, found work in Sheldon,\\r\\nIowa, and urged a friend to join him in America. In 1889 he reported\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"88\"&gt;\\r\\nconfidentially that he had saved $8.25 in just one week, and although that\\r\\nwas extraordinary, he could expect an average income of $20 per month.\\r\\nMost importantly, Nijhuis claimed that he could save most of his wages\\r\\nbecause he only needed to pay cash for clothing and tobacco. Urging his\\r\\nfriend to join him in Iowa, Nijhuis promised:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;If you have the desire to come and can\\'t earn as much in one\\r\\nsummer as it costs for a round trip, I will give you the return passage.\\r\\nBut I have no worry about that. Once you come here you will be glad\\r\\nto stay.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFour years later, Nijhuis continued to encourage immigration:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Why don\\'t you come to this country? If you don\\'t like it you\\r\\ncan go back. There is demand for hired hands this fall if you have\\r\\nenough money to come. Don\\'t be afraid that you won\\'t get enough to\\r\\nreturn. I now earn $25 per month and $20 in the winter. I could go\\r\\nback to Holland every winter and still have twice as much left over as\\r\\nyou. The reason I don\\'t come back is not for fear of the ocean. I\\r\\ndon\\'t worry about that. But I worry about spending all my savings.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAvailable records do not demonstrate that Nijhuis visited the\\r\\nNetherlands, but if he did, it was probably to find a wife. In each of his\\r\\nletters he urged his friend to report \"how things stand with all the boys and\\r\\ngirls I know,\" and on one occasion he wrote, \"There are not very many girls\\r\\nhere.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nOthers, however, found the supply of Dutch girls very adequate. J&amp;dot;\\r\\nOosteralting declared that he would not return to Erm, Drenthe, to find a\\r\\ngirl because \"there are enough here in America, and most of them are Hollanders.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nYoung men like Nijhuis and Berghuis were certainly able to\\r\\naccumulate capital, but deciding where they could most successfully begin\\r\\nfarming was more complicated. They all recognized the outstanding fertility\\r\\nof Sioux County soil, but could not readily purchase the costly land of that\\r\\ndistrict. Thus, many moved and invested their savings in neighboring states.\\r\\nOf his friends Nijhuis reported that one had gone to Mexico, and another\\r\\nto Minnesota.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nJ&amp;dot; Brouwer, who immigrated from Andrijk in 1888, examined several\\r\\nlocations before selecting a permanent home in Iowa. His search began in\\r\\nRoseland, Illinois, which he found too expensive and crowded. He\\r\\ncomplained that the place he had rented for ten dollars per month didn\\'t\\r\\neven have enough space to raise a few potatoes. Within one year he moved\\r\\nto Orange City, Iowa, where he rented a fifteen-acre farm for fifteen dollars\\r\\nper month. But after a short time he found a larger farm of one hundred\\r\\nsixty acres. After consulting with several members of his family and the\\r\\nDominie, he purchased the farm and continued to cultivate it for eleven\\r\\nyears. Due to the rising value of Orange City land, Brouwer sold his farm at\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"89\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I33.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"map\"&gt;\\r\\na handsome profit in 1899. He then purchased a smaller eighty-acre farm in\\r\\nHornick and used the balance of his cash to pay off debts and provide\\r\\nassistance to each of his children.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn Hornick, only sixty miles south of Orange City, land sold for\\r\\ntwenty dollars per acre, while Brouwer\\'s farm had sold for forty-four dollars\\r\\nper acre. Hornick was an essentially American community; there Brouwer\\r\\njoined a small nucleus of twenty-four Dutch families who had also purchased\\r\\nthe inexpensive land of that region.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;South Dakota: Free Land&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFarms in South Dakota and Nebraska, however, could be acquired for\\r\\nmuch less money than those in Iowa. Immigrants who had little cash or\\r\\ncredit found these regions very attractive. Albert Kuipers, who immigrated\\r\\nto South Dakota in 1882, vigorously publicized the opportunities in that\\r\\nregion. Although born in poverty, he had farmed a small piece of heath\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"90\"&gt;\\r\\nland in Drenthe with some success. But after arriving in South Dakota, he\\r\\nwrote glowing reports of success in Charles Mix County, where he and his\\r\\nson had settled. The &lt;i&gt;Nieuw Advertentieblad&lt;/i&gt; in Friesland published Kuipers\\'s\\r\\naccount of Roelof Bartelds\\'s experience of 1888. Bartelds was the poorest\\r\\nimmigrant to accompany Kuipers to South Dakota. \"He was a poor peat\\r\\ndigger from Zuidwolde (Drenthe),\" who with his two children had to work a\\r\\nfull year to pay for their passage to America.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D059\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAfter working to pay off these debts, Bartelds, with Kuipers\\'s\\r\\nassistance, found a piece of open land. Kuipers wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;In the spring of 1882 Bartelds came to me and asked me if\\r\\nthere were any open lands in my neighborhood. I am in constant\\r\\ncommunication with the land office, and thus I always know what\\r\\nland is available. I showed him a piece of land near us in Platte Creek\\r\\nof about 160 acres for which he had to pay $15.50 to have it surveyed\\r\\nand registered. He is now a farmer on this 160 acres. He has a sod\\r\\nhouse there but also a wood stable and grainery. He has 64 acres\\r\\nunder cultivation and the rest in pasture and hay. He has four horses,\\r\\nseven cows, a number of pigs, and all the necessary farm machinery,\\r\\nincluding a self-binder which both cuts and binds. In short, he is a\\r\\ngood farmer.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;If you wish to write him, his address is R&amp;dot; Bartelds, P&amp;dot; O&amp;dot;&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I34.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"91\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Castalia, Charles Mix County, Dakota. Ask him with how much\\r\\nmoney he came here in 1882, and what he now has; how much he\\r\\nhas acquired from his farm this year, etc&amp;dot; Then you will hear directly\\r\\nfrom him how a poor laborer can progress, at least if he is willing to\\r\\nwork.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D060\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt is impossible to measure how much credibility prospective\\r\\nimmigrants allotted to Kuipers\\'s claims. The private reports of one brother\\r\\nto another probably carried far more authority. Ulbe Eringa, who\\r\\nimmigrated from Veldwijk in 1892, corresponded regularly with his family\\r\\nover twenty-five years, and such letters, passed from hand to hand, spread\\r\\ndetailed and reliable reports among Eringa\\'s family and friends.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDuring the summer of 1892, Eringa arrived in Hull, Iowa, where by\\r\\nprior arrangement he lived with a friend named Abma. Within a few days\\r\\nafter his arrival, \"A woman came riding up into the yard with two nice\\r\\nhorses and a wagon.\" This woman, Mrs&amp;dot; Hunt, had heard that a new Dutch\\r\\nfarmhand had arrived, and her husband needed help. Ulbe moved in with\\r\\nthis English family and wrote, \"They are real Americans and they speak\\r\\nEnglish, but it is very neat here and the people are very friendly.\" He\\r\\nbelieved that they were Christian people because they \"have five Bibles,\"\\r\\nbut, he continued, \"they don\\'t read them; that is not the custom here. Also\\r\\nthey don\\'t pray after meals. Mr&amp;dot; Hunt does say a small prayer before eating,\\r\\nbut I don\\'t understand him.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWithin a short time Eringa discovered a number of old acquaintances\\r\\nand friends in the neighborhood. In Orange City he met Johannes v&amp;dot; d&amp;dot;\\r\\nSchaaf, who had been a hired hand for Ulbe\\'s uncle in Friesland. Then, \"to\\r\\nmy surprise,\" he wrote, \"Hedser Reipstra lives a half hour off from me. He is\\r\\nan old friend of mine.... He lives with a big farmer and even owns an\\r\\nAmerican carriage. He may use the farmer\\'s horses for nothing, and I have\\r\\nridden with him three times already when he has taken me to church.\"\\r\\nWell satisfied with his new life, Eringa said, \"I am very much at home here,\\r\\nand I can hardly imagine that I am in America.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe activities of the Dutch church constantly attracted Ulbe, and\\r\\nover the years he supported its growth with time and money. In 1892 he\\r\\nattended a church in nearby Sioux Center and wrote, \"I almost forgot that I\\r\\nwas in America.\" In the same letter he said, \"All those things make me\\r\\nmore enthused about going to church here than in Veldwijk.\" It is not\\r\\ndifficult to understand this reaction. The church was the social center of the\\r\\nDutch-American community. Friends from all over the region gathered\\r\\nthere each Sunday, and after laboring among strangers, the Sunday services\\r\\nprovided a perfect opportunity to forget being in America. The church was\\r\\nalso an especially crucial institution for young men seeking a compatible\\r\\nspouse.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMaatje Riepstra, who became Ulbe\\'s wife, immigrated to Iowa in\\r\\n1893. Although they may have known each other in the Netherlands, their\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"92\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I35.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\ncourtship in Hull, Iowa, was facilitated by meeting each Sunday for worship\\r\\nand instruction. Working long hours six days each week allowed little time\\r\\nfor social activity. Thus, the church, whose explicit goals were religious,\\r\\nbecame the social center of the community. Here young people found mates\\r\\nwhile families visited and discussed the events of the previous week.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBy 1894, just two years after immigrating, Eringa was able to report\\r\\nprogress in achieving the most crucial goals of his life. He had found \"a fine\\r\\nwife,\" and they were living on a 220-acre farm in Running Water, South\\r\\nDakota. He had rented the land on shares which allowed him to keep two\\r\\nthirds of the harvest for his own livelihood. In the process he was acquiring\\r\\nlivestock and equipment which he used later on his own farm. His church\\r\\nhad elected him as an elder, and he was asked to read sermons in the\\r\\nabsence of a regular minister. \"It is good here,\" he declared.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThese concerns &amp;mdash; farm, family, and church &amp;mdash; constituted the abiding\\r\\nsubstance of Ulbe\\'s life. As a farmer he progressed steadily, acquiring his\\r\\nown 160-acre farm in 1899. By 1904 he had accumulated 320 acres and\\r\\nspoke hopefully of paying off the balance of his mortgage. In 1918 he was\\r\\nalready looking forward to retirement and to the prospect of his son\\'s\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"93\"&gt;\\r\\ninheriting the farm. During most of these years Ulbe was not land-poor,\\r\\nbecause he sold cattle and hogs for cash in Chicago. On several occasions\\r\\nhe visited the huge Chicago slaughterhouses and traveled from there to\\r\\nGrand Rapids, Michigan, where he discovered old friends whom he had not\\r\\nseen for twenty-five years. In 1910 he visited the Netherlands with his oldest\\r\\ndaughter to strengthen the familial ties which his frequent correspondence\\r\\nhad preserved. Two of his daughters became teachers, while a third, living\\r\\nnearby, married Johannes v&amp;dot; d&amp;dot; Wei, a farmer and \"a good man.\" Ulbe\\'s only\\r\\nson, Pier, seemed well inclined to life on the farm, and Ulbe expected to\\r\\nleave him a goodly inheritance.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBy participating constantly in the life of his church, Ulbe expanded\\r\\nhis cultural horizons. As a leading elder, he read sermons to the\\r\\ncongregation during the frequent absence of an ordained minister, and on\\r\\ntwo occasions he attended synodical meetings in New York, where he\\r\\n\"heard sermons from the best ministers and missionaries of the Holland\\r\\nReformed Church.\" These occasions, together with his business trips to\\r\\nChicago, exposed Eringa to a large part of America. Eighteen years after his\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I36.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"94\"&gt;\\r\\nimmigration, Ulbe had become a solid citizen of South Dakota and the\\r\\nDutch-American community.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nRunning Water, Eringa\\'s home, was but one of a dozen Dutch\\r\\ncommunities in the southeastern part of South Dakota. Concentrated\\r\\nprimarily in Charles Mix and Douglas Counties, these settlements never\\r\\nprospered as those in Iowa did. Drought forced many immigrants to sell or\\r\\nleave their homesteads and resettle elsewhere. Towns like Nieveen,\\r\\nFriesland, and Running Water were all abandoned. That phenomenon, of\\r\\ncourse, was not peculiar to South Dakota. Even in fertile Iowa more than\\r\\ntwo thousand towns and villages were abandoned during the first hundred\\r\\nyears of the state\\'s existence. Villages without rail connections had little\\r\\nchance of survival, and many towns were organized by promoters who\\r\\nadvertised the virtues of their new sites only to sell land. Frequently\\r\\nrailroads founded towns on their own property and then assured the success\\r\\nof their investments by restricting access to rail transportation within the\\r\\ncompany\\'s town, while causing nearby towns to decline.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWhen the big influx of Dutch settlers entered South Dakota in the\\r\\nearly 1880s, immigrants from several other European countries joined them.\\r\\nEach national group tended to establish its own villages, while Americans,\\r\\nmixing freely among most of the immigrants, usually controlled the\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I37.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"95\"&gt;\\r\\ncounties\\' governmental structure. In Douglas County the Ukrainians,\\r\\nGermans, and Dutch clustered in separate national groups, while in Charles\\r\\nMix County, Dutch villages stood near others with Swedish and Norwegian\\r\\ninhabitants. Ethnic cohesion of this sort was a common feature on the\\r\\nAmerican landscape. Ulbe Eringa noted in 1903 that he had rented a 160-acre\\r\\nfarm from a Norwegian. \"This family,\" he wrote, \"acquired the farm 30\\r\\nyears ago for nothing (under the Homestead Law), and now they can sell it\\r\\nfor $40 per acre. This sixty-year-old couple is moving to a Norwegian city in\\r\\nMinnesota.\" Ulbe concluded, \"That is the way things are here in America.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;From Wisconsin to Nebraska&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe first Dutch immigrants to cultivate the flat Nebraska plains came\\r\\nfrom Wisconsin. J&amp;dot; W&amp;dot; Lefferink, who immigrated to Cedar Grove,\\r\\nWisconsin, in 1868, found little opportunity in that already-crowded village.\\r\\nWithin one year he moved to Lancaster County, Nebraska. Soon others\\r\\nfollowed.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThree Te Selle brothers, who immigrated to Wisconsin in 1865,\\r\\nmoved to Nebraska by 1882. Jon Hendrick Te Selle migrated first, then\\r\\nwrote to his family in Winterswijk, describing Nebraska:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;The soil is black clay, no sand, and it has almost no\\r\\nstones... if you crush it between your fingers you find it to be very\\r\\nsoft and without any gravel. The land is thickly covered with grass\\r\\nand has no trees.... We sold our land in Wisconsin for $900. We\\r\\nsold our goods and livestock for $387. We have not had to spend our\\r\\nsavings here, and we live tax free for five years.\"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;note ref=\"2\"&gt;2 &lt;i&gt;Under the Homestead Law of 1862 a settler was only required to pay for the survey and registration\\r\\nof his land, and such homesteads were tax-free for five years. During that time the settler was obliged to\\r\\noccupy and cultivate his land, and thereafter he received a legal title of ownership.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFor a time Jon Hendrick\\'s brother Harm remained in Wisconsin,\\r\\nstruggling to improve his position. In 1867 he was cultivating forty acres,\\r\\nbut had sold another thirty acres of woodland for $750. He calculated that\\r\\nearning 8 percent interest on $750 would bring more income than selling\\r\\nthe lumber. \"Wood is not worth much here because the cost of cutting it is\\r\\ntoo high.\" Writing to his brother Derk in Winterswijk, Harm Jan reported\\r\\nthat land prices were rising rapidly in Wisconsin. Land for which he had\\r\\npaid $25 per acre in 1865 was selling at $50 in 1870. It was also difficult to\\r\\nfind rental property. So Harm suggested that Derk might want to settle in\\r\\nNebraska, where their brother had moved.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNebraska had already become an intriguing option for Harm, and he\\r\\neagerly awaited his brother\\'s detailed report on the area. In any event, he\\r\\nwanted a larger farm. He had tried to purchase two hundred acres from a\\r\\nneighbor who hoped to resettle near his family in Michigan. But the\\r\\nneighbor returned from Michigan reporting that land there was too\\r\\nexpensive and that he had decided to stay in Wisconsin.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"96\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D061\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFinally news from brother Jon arrived, and Harm, reporting its\\r\\ncontents to the family in Winterswijk, said:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Brother J&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; is no longer here; he has moved at least 500\\r\\nmiles further west to the state of Nebraska. There the land is cheap.\\r\\nThere people can buy 100 acres for $80. But they have almost no\\r\\nwood there and at first they have to build a house from sod, or of\\r\\n&amp;lsquo;plaggen&amp;rsquo; as you call it, because lumber costs very much there and it\\r\\nmust be carted over a 13-hour trip. From what I hear it is a total\\r\\nwilderness.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I don\\'t yet know exactly how things are with brother J&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; On\\r\\nthe 28th of March he sold his land and all his goods and then left. He\\r\\nhas not written us a letter but has written to his father-in-law that\\r\\nthey arrived in good health and that the trip cost $100 &amp;mdash; also that the\\r\\nroad passed through terrific mountains and that in some places they\\r\\ncan hardly find water. One man dug a well 100 feet deep and still\\r\\nfound no water. They can get coal there four hours away at $.25 per\\r\\nbushel. They have to use that for fuel because they have no wood.\\r\\nMore people have gone there, but I know of two who have already\\r\\nreturned as they did not like it. I know little more about it, although\\r\\nsome people write that there are many rattle snakes and prairie wolves\\r\\nout there.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D062\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAside from inexpensive land, there was little in that report to attract\\r\\na prospective immigrant. But acquiring land was the main objective, and for\\r\\nHarm, Wisconsin was no longer a land of opportunity &amp;mdash; especially after he\\r\\nfaced a severe pest problem in 1870:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;As for the potatoes and what they will produce, I don\\'t know\\r\\nwhat to expect. Last year we were plagued enormously with worms;\\r\\nthey ate everything green. Now it is even worse &amp;mdash; it seems that as\\r\\nsoon as the potatoes can be seen growing, the worms come out of the\\r\\nground and sit waiting with their mouths open.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis problem, though clearly aggravating, was not the main cause of\\r\\nHarm\\'s migration to Nebraska. Rather, it was the high price of land which\\r\\ncontinued to restrict his ambition. In 1870 he wrote that several recent\\r\\nDutch immigrants, expecting to purchase farms in Wisconsin, had been\\r\\nforced to become day laborers. Although their wage, $1.50 per day, was\\r\\nmuch higher than they could have expected in the Netherlands, these\\r\\npeople were deeply disappointed. Together with Harm, they drifted\\r\\nwestward.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHarm joined his brother on Nebraska\\'s windy flatlands. During his\\r\\nfirst year there he witnessed one of the prairie\\'s most dreaded hazards.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;On Sunday, October 15, we went to church in the morning\\r\\nand the wind was already blowing terrifically.... Then, when we&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"97\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;came out of church, we saw smoke in the distance because the prairie\\r\\nwas on fire. The prairie is all grass here... and when it is dry, it\\r\\nburns tremendously... and it can burn for miles. Thus, as I said,\\r\\nas we came out of church we saw the fire. One man &amp;mdash; his name is\\r\\nNicholas Vander Velde &amp;mdash; saw that it was not far from his house. He\\r\\nwas in church with his wife and two children, but had three children\\r\\nat home.... He ran as fast as he could to go home, but then he\\r\\nsaw that his house was nothing but ashes &amp;mdash; his hay, grain, barn, and\\r\\npigs all burned. But that was not the worst. In the distance he saw\\r\\nsomething white lying on the ground, and he thought it was a calf, but\\r\\nas he came closer, he saw that it was his oldest daughter burned to\\r\\ndeath. After further search he found the two other children burned to\\r\\ndeath in the ruins of the house. There was also much other\\r\\ndestruction from the fire.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D063\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDespite such hazards, the Te Selle brothers remained in Nebraska,\\r\\nenduring successive disasters from grasshoppers and drought between 1873\\r\\nand 1875. By 1876 conditions improved, and the community grew. G&amp;dot; J&amp;dot;,\\r\\nanother of the brothers, arrived in 1882. By that time the area had the\\r\\nregular services of a Dutch church. Its members tended to cluster near each\\r\\nother for mutual assistance and social compatibility. Describing a segment of\\r\\nFirth, Nebraska, in 1882, Harm wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;W&amp;dot; Leverdink is my next-door neighbor, Obbink van de Hoort\\r\\nlives [near] us, and brother Jon Hendrick a half mile away. Kolte has\\r\\nnow bought 80 acres of my land, and he will rent or sell his other\\r\\nplace because he wants to live among the Hollanders. We are three\\r\\nmiles from the church, but everyone drives here, and people do not\\r\\nhave to ask if they may ride along. Everyone just steps into the wagon&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I38.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"98\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;as long as there is room. Here there is no difference between the poor\\r\\nand the rich.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAfter the difficulties of the 1870s were behind them, the Te Selle\\r\\nbrothers prospered. They expanded their farms and acquired additional land\\r\\nfor their numerous children. By 1895 J&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; Te Selle had purchased 480\\r\\nacres &amp;mdash; more than he could cultivate. His daughters found husbands among\\r\\nneighboring Dutch farmers, and his brothers also prospered. Among them,\\r\\nthe Te Selle brothers had at least twenty-five children. Their community in\\r\\nFirth grew steadily, and by 1948 the local Dutch church numbered three\\r\\nhundred families. In general, however, Nebraska never attracted large\\r\\nnumbers of Dutch-Americans.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D064\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Come to Kansas&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nKansas, another of the Great Plains states, also attracted a small group\\r\\nof Dutch immigrants, but the pattern of settlement closely resembled that of\\r\\nSouth Dakota and Nebraska. Roelof Mulder moved from Firth to Luctor,\\r\\nKansas, in 1891. Describing their new home, Mulder\\'s wife, Anje Nieveen,\\r\\nwrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Dear Uncle, I received your letter in the beginning of March &amp;mdash;\\r\\nnot in Nebraska, but in Kansas. We left Nebraska on the third of\\r\\nMarch. As you probably know, we did not have our own land there.\\r\\nThe 160 acres we tilled there was owned by Jim, Roelof, and their\\r\\nfather together. Now that father Mulder has died, the land was sold,\\r\\nand now Roelof has bought 160 acres here. You are probably\\r\\nthinking, my but you move often &amp;mdash; yes, that is the American spirit.\\r\\nThe land in Nebraska was already expensive. We sold it &amp;mdash; 160 acres,&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I39.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"99\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;two houses and some stables &amp;mdash; for $4,000. And now Roelof has\\r\\npurchased this land for $1,500 &amp;mdash; without a house, but it has a stable.\\r\\nThe creek runs across the land at an angle so that on one side we\\r\\nhave 90 acres and 70 acres on the other side. It is a running creek so\\r\\nthat we have more than enough water for our livestock. Also, there\\r\\nare trees on both sides of the creek which we can use for fuel.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;There is less expensive land available here as well as more\\r\\nexpensive, depending on whether it has buildings on it and upon the\\r\\nlocation. Because we didn\\'t have enough time to build a house this\\r\\nspring, we have rented a farm nearby which Roelof and his brother\\r\\nwork together, and this winter we will build our own house. It looks\\r\\ngood to me here &amp;mdash; as good as Nebraska. But it is still not densely\\r\\npopulated. We live five miles from the Holland Church where\\r\\nDominie Scholten is the minister. He is a young minister, but still\\r\\nvery serious and with a soft voice. They have a nice church here and\\r\\nthe minister gets a $700 salary. We are also five miles from the\\r\\nrailroad station, where we bring our crops and can buy lumber. The\\r\\nland here is a little more hilly than in Dakota, but there the soil has\\r\\nmore stones and rocks. We have found none here.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Things go well here for us in all earthly matters. We have a\\r\\ngood living and so does the rest of the family. Still we must work\\r\\nhard.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAnje Nieveen\\'s description of Luctor, Kansas, could easily be used to\\r\\nsketch the circumstances she shared with several hundred other Dutch\\r\\nimmigrants in Kansas and Nebraska. Large colonies did not develop in these\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I40.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"100\"&gt;\\r\\nstates. Instead, a few isolated Dutch communities have continued to survive\\r\\namid seemingly endless fields of wheat. With proper rainfall, Kansas and\\r\\nNebraska have yielded enormous harvests. Kansas alone produces one-fifth\\r\\nof the nation\\'s wheat crop.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D065\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Disaster in Colorado&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe arid southwest &amp;mdash; Texas, Colorado, and their neighboring states &amp;mdash;\\r\\nalso attracted the Dutch immigrants\\' attention, although no extensive\\r\\nDutch colony developed in these regions. Several colonization efforts in\\r\\nTexas failed, and in Colorado one widely publicized venture ended in total\\r\\ndisarray.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nC&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; Sluys, who immigrated from Enkhuizen in 1892, joined this\\r\\nColorado venture after reading a pamphlet circulated by the \"Nederlandsch-Americaansche\\r\\nLand en Emigratie Maatschappij.\" This organization, which\\r\\noriginated in the Netherlands, extolled the virtues of land in the San Luis\\r\\nValley, describing it as the \"Italy of western North America.\" In that\\r\\nregion, the promoters promised, a farm of eighty acres could produce\\r\\nenough to pay all the farmer\\'s obligations and provide a profit of 6-7,000\\r\\nguilders annually. After reading the pamphlet, C&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; Sluys and his wife\\r\\nagreed that they would like to join the emigrant society, but not without\\r\\ntheir father\\'s consent. They asked him to read the pamphlet, with the prior\\r\\nunderstanding that they would use his reaction as a sign. If he counseled\\r\\nagainst emigration, they would remain in the Netherlands. After reading\\r\\nthe advertisement, the old man said, \"Even if this is only half true, I still\\r\\nbelieve that it would be better to join that venture than to remain here.\"\\r\\nThe credibility of the Colorado venture was further enhanced by the\\r\\nsupport it received from a respected theology professor, M&amp;dot; Noordzij, from\\r\\nKampen. Thus the die was cast, and the C&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; Sluys family joined a group\\r\\nof 211 emigrants sailing toward Colorado.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nUpon their arrival the settlers were housed in two barracks, each\\r\\ncontaining a hundred people. C&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; Sluys reported that the high altitude,\\r\\n8,000 feet above sea level, was too radical a change for people who had\\r\\nbeen raised in the lowlands, and that at night the winter temperatures\\r\\ndropped far below zero. Then, in these compressed living conditions, scarlet\\r\\nfever broke out among the children, causing eleven of them to die. \"Our\\r\\nyoungest darling,\" Sluys wrote, \"a girl of eight months, was the last of\\r\\nthese.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe pamphlet which attracted these folk to Colorado proved to be a\\r\\ncomplete fabrication. Its author had never visited the site. If he had, he\\r\\nwould have recognized that the area\\'s dry soil was totally useless. The\\r\\ndisappointed immigrants telegraphed Professor Noordzij and he responded,\\r\\n\"I\\'m coming immediately.\" Before he arrived, the colony split up, but a\\r\\nnumber remained together, awaiting the professor\\'s assistance. When he\\r\\nappeared, it was agreed that they should find better land at a lower altitude.\\r\\nSome, then settled on government land near the Nebraska border.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"101\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMeanwhile, C&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; Sluys felt obliged to report their troublesome\\r\\nexperiences to the newspaper in Enkhuizen. When news of this sabotage\\r\\nreached the immigration society\\'s agent in Colorado, Sluys was thrown out\\r\\nof the colony. Hearing this, Sluys\\'s wife, whom he described as \"not easily\\r\\ndiscouraged,\" broke down. \"Now what must we do,\" she wailed, \"8000 miles\\r\\nfrom our family, in a land where we can hardly speak the language and\\r\\nthrown out of the colony with neither money nor food in sight, and then\\r\\nwithout a house in two days?\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSluys sought advice from an English neighbor for whom his fourteen-year-old\\r\\ndaughter had been working. Following his neighbor\\'s advice, Sluys\\r\\nfound work with a railroad construction crew sixteen miles away. Soon\\r\\nthereafter part of the colony disbanded. Most of them received assistance\\r\\nfrom Dutch churches in Iowa and relocated in the older colonies. A few,\\r\\nlike Sluys, drifted from one place to another.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWorking by turns on railroad construction and as a farmer, Sluys\\r\\nremained in Colorado for about ten years. His farming efforts were hindered\\r\\nby conflicts over water rights (irrigation was necessary in Colorado) and by\\r\\ndistant markets. Without railroad connections his crops had to be sold\\r\\nlocally, and the sparse Colorado population produced slight demand. On\\r\\none occasion prices were so low that the local farmers burned their grain for\\r\\nfuel.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFor a time Sluys worked as a gardener in Sterling, Colorado, while his\\r\\nwife operated a restaurant in their home. Finally, exasperated by the dry and\\r\\ncapricious climate, Sluys decided \"to move northward or toward the Pacific\\r\\nCoast.\" For one year he labored in Nebraska, saving money to finance his\\r\\none-thousand-mile trek to Montana. After reaching Great Falls, Montana,\\r\\nhe ran out of money and again found employment with a railroad\\r\\nconstruction gang. He became a shift boss and was forced to move westward\\r\\nwith the progress of the railroad\\'s construction, but he gained free housing\\r\\nat each new location.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThen, in 1908, he returned to farming on government land near\\r\\nConrad, Montana, where he acquired 560 acres: Unable to locate water for\\r\\nirrigation, he sold part of this land and moved to another location in the\\r\\nConrad area. There he was quite successful.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBy 1923 part of his family had migrated to Lynden, Washington, and\\r\\nSluys followed his children to that successful Dutch Colony. There, where\\r\\nthe Pacific Ocean restricted the westward movement, Sluys returned to\\r\\ngardening and cultivated several acres to provide for himself. \"Lynden,\" he\\r\\nwrote, \"is a good place; there is much land here close to the river which is\\r\\nas fertile as the best land in Holland for agriculture.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nTo choose such a lonely trek was exceptional among the Calvinist\\r\\nDutch immigrants. On one occasion Sluys wrote that he had not seen\\r\\nanother Dutchman in seven years. He did, however, communicate regularly\\r\\nwith his family in Enkhuizen, and he was happy to discover Dutch churches\\r\\nin Conrad, Montana, and Lynden, Washington.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"102\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nLynden and its neighboring Dutch settlements were among the last to\\r\\nbe founded by Dutch-Americans. Like Orange City, Firth, and Running\\r\\nWater, they were established to satisfy a constant demand for inexpensive\\r\\nland. The founding of the Washington settlements occurred in the late\\r\\n1890s, during the last days of the general American frontier. Thus, while\\r\\nopen land existed, the Dutch joined other Americans in their pursuit of\\r\\nagricultural opportunities. The most successful Dutch colonies on the West\\r\\nCoast were established by immigrants with previous experience in older\\r\\ncolonies where land had become scarce or expensive.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;The Pacific Coast&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nOak Harbor, Washington, was the Dutch-Americans\\' first colony on\\r\\nthe Pacific Coast. Reports of that area\\'s fertility reached the older Dutch\\r\\nsettlements after 1894, and soon settlers were arriving from western\\r\\nMichigan, Chicago, and South Dakota. They acquired farms of forty or\\r\\neighty acres, still encumbered with stumps left by lumber companies. After\\r\\nclearing the land, the settlers immediately established a church. By 1898\\r\\nfour additional Dutch colonies were located in the far northwest corner of\\r\\nWashington. Among these Lynden became the most prosperous.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn many respects conditions in the Washington colonies resembled\\r\\nthose of western Michigan in the 1850s. Opportunities for employment were\\r\\nvaried: poor immigrants could begin as laborers in the sawmills and\\r\\nfisheries. Those bent on agriculture could acquire stump land while working\\r\\nas day laborers. Others, who preferred business and trade, found markets\\r\\nand harbor facilities in the cities along the Pacific Coast.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nOene Heller, who immigrated from Ulrum in 1891, settled first near\\r\\nHolland, Michigan; but in 1896, after minimal progress there, he moved to\\r\\nOak Harbor, Washington. Heller had struggled with a ten-acre farm in\\r\\nMichigan, supplementing that narrow living as a day laborer. In Oak\\r\\nHarbor he reported earning twice as much as he had in Michigan. He\\r\\nacquired land and expected to build a new house there. Meanwhile, he\\r\\nrented a house in the village of Oak Harbor. The fishing fleets that docked\\r\\nnearby often provided him and his neighbors with free fish. Heller\\'s wife\\r\\nreported that they had acquired \"a whole sack full for each of the five\\r\\nGroninger families living in their neighborhood.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1897 Heller wrote, \"Many Hollanders have followed us here.\" He\\r\\nwas making high wages and expected to begin cultivating his land that\\r\\nspring. Comparing Washington with Michigan, he wrote, \"People don\\'t\\r\\nhave to work in the cold and snow. I would not go back to Michigan for\\r\\n$1,000. That is the truth. We are all happy that we made the trip.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHeller\\'s zeal differed little from the enthusiasm expressed by those of\\r\\nhis predecessors who discovered pleasant circumstances in Michigan, South\\r\\nDakota, and elsewhere. But the West Coast did offer an extraordinarily\\r\\nattractive climate. Lacking Michigan\\'s harsh winters and the hot dry winds\\r\\nof the prairie states, Washington and California offered a more ideal\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"103\"&gt;\\r\\nclimate, together with astonishingly fertile valleys. The economic potential\\r\\nin California was especially obvious, but despite several organized efforts to\\r\\nlure Dutch settlers there, no successful colony grew in California until after\\r\\nthe turn of the century.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBy 1910 a small community of Dutch-Americans had settled in\\r\\nRedlands, California, where they organized a Dutch church. After several\\r\\npoor crops, many of these people resettled in Los Angeles, where they\\r\\norganized another church. Dutch communities in California began to thrive\\r\\nafter 1917, when a group from South Dakota organized a community in\\r\\nRipon and a number of Frisians settled in Bellflower. The latter quickly\\r\\nbecame a dairy center, and farmers with huge herds hired young people from\\r\\nthe Dutch communities of the Midwest as helpers. Many of these remained\\r\\nin California to establish their own dairy herds, where, as one immigrant\\r\\nwrote, \"they do nothing but milk the cows and sell the cream, and the only\\r\\ncrop they raise in alfalfa.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAfter World War II a large contingent of Dutch immigrants settled in\\r\\nCalifornia. An even greater number moved to Canada.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D066\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Canada, Too&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe first Dutch-Canadian immigrants preceded the World War II\\r\\ninflux. A number of Dutch-Americans resettled in the western provinces of\\r\\nCanada during the 1890s, taking advantage of lenient homestead laws.\\r\\nAnother group of families immigrated to Manitoba in 1892; by 1913 a Dutch\\r\\ncommunity numbering approximately 1,000 people had grown in Winnipeg.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nStill other settlers &amp;mdash; W&amp;dot;M&amp;dot; Bos, for example, an immigrant from\\r\\nDrenthe &amp;mdash; were drawn to several parts of Saskatchewan. Like so many of his\\r\\npredecessors, Bos began his immigrant life as a farmhand. However, he was\\r\\nno pauper. He worked for a large Canadian farmer to gain experience and\\r\\nadditional time for selecting a favorable location. Indicating the priorities\\r\\nthat governed his land choice, Bos wrote in 1911:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Last week I went to Swift Current... and looked at some\\r\\nland. But I have not yet found anything that looks good to me.\\r\\nPerhaps I shall also look in Montana where many farms are available.\\r\\nThey already have a Dutch settlement there, and they also have a\\r\\nchurch. I believe I will find more satisfaction there, although I will\\r\\nprobably make less money in Montana. But I often tell myself, you\\r\\nonly have one life to live and there is no reason why you shouldn\\'t\\r\\nbenefit from the privileges already available in Montana.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe following year Bos reported that he had chosen to remain in\\r\\nCanada, a choice influenced by the organization of a \"Gereformeerde\"\\r\\nchurch in the settlement of Cramersburg.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Our church is not very large, but it has a good chance to\\r\\npersevere. At present ministers serve us at least four times each year&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"104\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I41.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"portrait\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"105\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;and they remain with us several weeks each time. At the same time\\r\\nthey administer the sacraments. Otherwise we have two sermon\\r\\nreadings each Sunday which the elders deliver.... It gives us much\\r\\npleasure to join the family of faith at God\\'s altar. We have already\\r\\nbegun to collect money to build a church and pay our expenses.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAfter his third year in Canada, Bos planned to publicize advice to\\r\\nprospective immigrants in Groningen and Drenthe. He was particularly\\r\\nconcerned about immigrants who, in searching for land, would find\\r\\nthemselves widely separated from the Reformed church community and its\\r\\nspiritual benefits:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Perhaps I will write a piece for a few Holland newspapers this\\r\\nwinter. My main purpose will be to warn our &amp;lsquo;Gereformeerde&amp;rsquo; people\\r\\nparticularly not to forsake the fellowship of the church. Of course, it\\r\\nis true that the Lord will establish his church over the whole world,\\r\\nbut there are many people who follow the example of Lot, who chose\\r\\nthe plain of Jordan where the surrounding godlessness tormented his\\r\\nsoul. Also, many people immigrate like blind men. It is especially\\r\\ndifficult for families to find a good place immediately. But now, helped\\r\\nby our church\\'s home mission activity, many new churches have been\\r\\nestablished in Canada. These have made it possible for newcomers to\\r\\nestablish themselves within the circle of the church.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn 1912 Bos married. Reporting about that event, he wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;This year has brought me the purest desire of my life on earth &amp;mdash;\\r\\nthat is, a loving wife. Being married is fine, much better than tending\\r\\nyour own pot of food like a hermit.... Together we have a full and\\r\\nsatisfying life. We eat well and help each other as much as possible to\\r\\nmake life pleasant. We have begun our household with the intention\\r\\nof taking the high road. It is our common practice to pray both before\\r\\nand after mealtimes. I close the meal with audible prayer and my wife\\r\\nreads a chapter from God\\'s Word.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt would be easy to denigrate Bos\\'s piety as either excessively atypical,\\r\\nor the temporary enthusiasm of a newlywed. To contend that the sheen of\\r\\nhis polished intentions probably tarnished with time is merely common\\r\\nsense. But however atypical, temporary, or ultimately tarnished, Bos\\'s values\\r\\nare precisely those which have preserved ethnic identity in Dutch-America.\\r\\nReaching from New Jersey to California, Dutch settlements of every size\\r\\nhave been bound together by their chosen denominations. Pious families\\r\\nsought instruction and inspiration in their local churches, which became\\r\\nthe religious-cultural eye through which the immigrants viewed American\\r\\nsociety.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"106\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I42.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"107\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D067\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div2 name=\"Chapter 6 Dutch Churches in America\" type=\"chapter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;he retention of ethnic identity among Dutch-Americans leans\\r\\nheavily on the preservation of their churches. The\\r\\ninterrelationship of these two factors can hardly be\\r\\noveremphasized: in fact, no Dutch community in America has\\r\\nsurvived without its Dutch churches. Throughout the period of\\r\\nimmigration, those communities that were unable to support a church\\r\\ndisintegrated rapidly.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBut the Dutch church in America was no monolith. From the outset\\r\\nit was a fragmented body; its members disagreed about theology, church\\r\\npolity, and the elements of worship. Some of these distinctions had origins\\r\\nin the various Dutch provinces from which the immigrants came, but the\\r\\nmost powerful divisions grew within the American setting. The potential for\\r\\ndenominational unity fractured on the rock of Americanization.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDutch-Americans drew the issues of their debates from their\\r\\necclesiastical experience in the Netherlands, trying, as much as possible, to\\r\\nmaintain those practices that they carried with them to the New World.\\r\\nEach church group defended its views by appealing to confessional\\r\\nstatements and practices originating in the Netherlands; innovations were\\r\\nsuspect. Thus, whenever the customs of American church life made inroads\\r\\ninto the immigrant churches, new conflicts developed.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nTo preserve and perpetuate their views, the immigrants established\\r\\nschools and seminaries that drew upon the intellectual traditions and\\r\\nresources of the Netherlands. Immigrant children who sought professional\\r\\ncareers frequently attended the schools their parents had founded. There\\r\\nthey acquired respect for an intellectual tradition and piety born in the\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"108\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I43.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\nNetherlands. Many of these students &amp;mdash; especially ministers and teachers &amp;mdash;\\r\\npracticed their professions within the immigrant communities scattered\\r\\nacross the North American continent. Thus, through successive\\r\\ngenerations, the Dutch-American community has trained its own leaders,\\r\\nwho, in turn, have preserved an essential core of the Dutch-American\\r\\ntradition.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;A Pious Folk&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nPiety, the most obvious foundation of that tradition, was not peculiar\\r\\nto any fragment of Dutch-Americans. Virtually all the immigrants, Catholic\\r\\nand Protestant &amp;mdash; from farms, shops, cities and towns &amp;mdash; accounted for their\\r\\ndaily circumstances with references to God\\'s pleasure and judgment. This\\r\\nattitude probably grew stronger among those who faced the uncertainties of\\r\\nimmigration, but prior to the extreme secularization of the twentieth\\r\\ncentury, Christians everywhere spoke more readily of God\\'s hand in nature\\r\\nor in daily affairs.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D068\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWith the passing of each old year, the immigrants frequently wrote\\r\\nreflections on the year\\'s events. E&amp;dot; Wonnink\\'s letter of 1872 provides an\\r\\nespecially clear example of this custom:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"109\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We can report that we are all in good health, and it is our\\r\\nfondest wish to hear the same of you. The old year has quickly passed\\r\\nby with all of its good fortune and adversity &amp;mdash; with its joys and griefs.\\r\\nBut, on the other hand, we have seen much evidence of God\\'s mercy.\\r\\nWhen we confess our sins, he draws us to himself, either with love\\r\\nand blessing or with fatherly chastisements &amp;mdash; all this to make us more\\r\\ndependent on him. So we stand ready to enter the new year, not\\r\\nknowing what it will bring. But if we place all our trust in Him, we\\r\\nneed not fear the future, whether it bring prosperity or adversity.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlthough more elaborately expressed with the changing of the year,\\r\\nsuch expressions of dependence on God appeared regularly in the\\r\\nimmigrants\\' correspondence. For them closeness to God was a way of life.\\r\\nFear of ill health and death constantly pursued the people of the last\\r\\ncentury; few immigrant letters can be found without greetings\\r\\nacknowledging, \"through God\\'s goodness, I remain in good health.\" The\\r\\nwords of C&amp;dot; Snoeyenbosch demonstrate a common pattern of \"taking leave\":\\r\\n\"Now we will close for this time and wish you the blessings of the Almighty\\r\\non both your body and soul &amp;mdash; for time and for eternity.\" When sickness\\r\\noccurred, the usual response followed the example of H&amp;dot; Tijnes, who wrote\\r\\nin 1900, \"Father was seriously ill, but the Lord, who holds our life in his\\r\\nhands, and who directs all our paths, has spared him.\" Death, \"exchanging\\r\\ntime with eternity,\" required more lengthy reports, but they commonly\\r\\nconcluded with the firm conviction that all would be well because \"the Lord\\r\\nreigns.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe immigrants applied this matter-of-fact dependence on God\\'s\\r\\nprovidence to virtually every facet of their lives. In 1850 G&amp;dot; Heerspink\\r\\nwrote, \"I also wish to tell you that under the wise and all-ruling providence\\r\\nof God, I have married Fenna Bouwkamp on the tenth of this month. She\\r\\ncomes from Voorwald in Graafschap Bentheim, and, God be thanked, we\\r\\nenjoy good health.\" E&amp;dot; Wonnink, after surviving shipwreck in 1871, wrote,\\r\\n\"God allowed the water to come upon us, but not over our lips.\" Writing\\r\\nfrom Orange City, Iowa, in 1882, H&amp;dot; Berghuis declared, \"It is so here that\\r\\npeople can prosper better than in the Netherlands &amp;mdash; if they will work and if\\r\\nthey enjoy the blessings of the Lord.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nGod\\'s hand also appeared in adversity, and although hard to bear, such\\r\\ndifficulties brought strengthened faith. Poor harvests or destructive storms\\r\\nwere understood as tests of faith or, perhaps, the consequence of sin. Pious\\r\\nfolk often agreed that a severe national crisis demonstrated God\\'s\\r\\nchastisement. During the bloody American Civil War Peter Baden wrote,\\r\\n\"The country is in a miserable situation; God is bringing judgment on its\\r\\nsons because they have neglected His laws.\" H&amp;dot; Gruppen understood the\\r\\neconomic depression of the 1930s as another of God\\'s chastisements and\\r\\nsaid, \"If the people show more respect for God, perhaps he will take the\\r\\nproblem away.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"110\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D069\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Flee The Future Wrath&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe earliest immigrants, those arriving before the 1870s, expressed\\r\\ntheir piety more openly than the second wave of newcomers. Some of the\\r\\nfirst immigrants believed that they had narrowly escaped God\\'s impending\\r\\njudgment on the Netherlands, and they urged their friends and relatives to\\r\\nflee the imminent visitation of God\\'s wrath. Rev&amp;dot; Adrian Zwemer, while\\r\\nexpressing affection for his native land, still felt constrained to advise Rev&amp;dot;\\r\\nHelenius de Cock in 1857, \"It is easy for me to pass judgment on you, but\\r\\nonly God knows men\\'s hearts. Still allow me to urge you &amp;mdash; flee the coming\\r\\nwrath.\" In 1850 G&amp;dot; Heerspink urged even more emphatically:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Now we would like to warn you while there is still time. Make\\r\\nhaste, make haste to flee God\\'s judgment on the Netherlands. For\\r\\nyou must believe it &amp;mdash; a dark cloud of judgment hangs over the\\r\\nNetherlands. Think about the situation there and you will discover, if\\r\\nit pleases God to enlighten your spirit, that the prophecy of Revelation\\r\\n18 is about to be fulfilled. Therefore, flee the certain wrath of God.\\r\\nCome here. Live in peace, and enjoy the good fruits of this land.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D070\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn less judgmental tones other immigrants proclaimed that God had\\r\\npreserved parts of North America as a special refuge for the Netherlanders\\r\\nwho fled the over-populated fatherland. In 1850 J&amp;dot; Dunnink wrote, \"It seems\\r\\nthat the Lord has preserved this place (western Michigan) especially for the\\r\\nNetherlanders.\" Writing from Grand Haven in 1854, Markus Nienhuis said:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I tell you that I never had better prospects for success than I\\r\\nhave here, and I am convinced that God did not create the world to\\r\\nbe so thickly populated that people must nearly eat each other out of\\r\\nhunger and let each other lie desolate. When I was in the\\r\\nNetherlands, I often heard it said that nothing could be done because\\r\\nthere were too many people in the world. But that is a mistaken\\r\\nimpression. I believe the rulers spread these ideas to discourage\\r\\nemigration. But it is not true. There is land enough on which\\r\\nmankind can live in abundance. Let them leave the Netherlands and\\r\\ncome here.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Zeelanders\\' Piety&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMost of the immigrants acknowledged God\\'s imprint on their lives,\\r\\nbut for others, particularly Zeelanders, piety turned inward. Their letters\\r\\nexhibit constant self-examination, demonstrating an extraordinary concern\\r\\nfor their spiritual condition. Often a large part of their correspondence\\r\\nconsisted of pious exhortations. For these, Christianity was more a matter of\\r\\ninner feelings than an acquiescence to God\\'s will. P&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Oggel, one of Van\\r\\nRaalte\\'s students from Axel, wrote of Rev&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Budding: \"He says what is\\r\\ngoing on in his own heart, and so far as I know, he is very trustworthy.\"\\r\\nBudding, a restless itinerant, was well-known for his independent\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"111\"&gt;\\r\\nspiritualism. Other immigrants from Zeeland were similarly inclined.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D071\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nPeter Lankester from Vere immigrated to the Milwaukee area in 1850\\r\\nand corresponded with his brother until 1867. In these letters Lankester not\\r\\nonly described his own spiritual condition but also frequently urged his\\r\\nfamily to examine their souls. For example, in 1855 he wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We hope that you and your family are being molded by the\\r\\nLord, but above all, that he has poured out his grace on you, because\\r\\nwe stand at death\\'s door every hour &amp;mdash; and what can we expect if we\\r\\nare not one with Christ....

Christians who emphasize their inner spiritual state and\\r\\nurge humankind to radical conversions frequently grow impatient with\\r\\ndoctrinal or denominational distinctions: in America, the major revivalists\\r\\nlike Billy Sunday and Billy Graham have usually been nondenominational,\\r\\noften proclaiming, \"No creed but Christ.\" Similarly pietistic Netherlanders\\r\\ncould easily identify with their American counterparts. P&amp;dot; Lankester, who\\r\\nattended a revival in 1865, reported:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;A few weeks ago a minister, sponsored by the [RCA] synod,\\r\\narrived here. He has been sent throughout America to be God\\'s agent\\r\\nin bringing the people to conversion and to awaken God\\'s people so\\r\\nthat the church may be enlarged and reveal godly lives. There are an\\r\\nexceptionally large number of churches here, and each has its own\\r\\nminister, but all of them have joined together in order to assist the\\r\\nguest minister, Mr&amp;dot; Potter. He has been here now for about 14 days\\r\\nand he preaches three times each day, while local ministers usually\\r\\noffer the prayers.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I have never before heard a man with such gifts. In the morning\\r\\nand at noon he preaches in the largest church, which holds 3,000,\\r\\nand at 7:30 in the evening he preaches in a rented auditorium which\\r\\neasily seats 6,000. I have never seen such a large gathering in one\\r\\nplace. Before each service they have a prayer hour and Mr&amp;dot; Potter&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"112\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;invites anyone who wishes to say something about their family or\\r\\nacquaintances to openly declare their desire for prayer. I have seen\\r\\nand heard many different men, women, and children take their turns\\r\\nby standing to declare their needs. I have attended the meeting with\\r\\nour minister several times and it was a moving experience. Some\\r\\npeople with unconverted husbands and children in the army or on the\\r\\nbattlefields sought prayers. Sometimes the tears flooded my eyes. This\\r\\nminister, Potter, will take no money whatsoever, nor will he allow a\\r\\ncollection. This is almost never done in American churches.

There are\\r\\nsmall places here with three churches and parsonages trying to call\\r\\nthree different ministers, when in fact one church, parsonage, and\\r\\nminister would be sufficient &amp;mdash; and then the two extra ministers could\\r\\nbe sent to other places in order to fulfill the command, \"Go out and\\r\\npreach the Gospel.\"&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I44.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"113\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D075\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;A Period of Confusion&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nA few immigrants, like R&amp;dot; Lohuis in Glen Roy, Iowa, complained that\\r\\nevery Dutch-American wanted his own private church. \"When we,\" he\\r\\nwrote in 1869, \"go to church, we go to the English church. We like that\\r\\nbest. We belong to the English Congregational or Presbyterian Church.\\r\\nThat is most like the big Reformed Church in Holland.\" To join an\\r\\n\"English\" church was rather uncommon among Dutch immigrants, but\\r\\nchoosing a church because of its similarity to a familiar church in the\\r\\nNetherlands was a very common immigrant pattern. Almost without\\r\\nexception the immigrants sought and joined those churches that seemed\\r\\nmost like the churches they had left behind. And when no satisfactory\\r\\ninstitution seemed available, they organized new churches and\\r\\ndenominations.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDuring the first decades of immigrant experience, Dutch-Americans\\r\\njoined or organized a variety of denominations. Van Raalte led most of the\\r\\nwest Michigan colony into a union with the Reformed Protestant Dutch\\r\\nChurch which had originated in New Amsterdam during the seventeenth\\r\\ncentury. But two congregations in the Michigan colony had difficulties with\\r\\nVan Raalte\\'s leadership and joined the Presbyterian denomination. In 1857\\r\\nanother segment rejected Van Raalte\\'s decision to affiliate with the\\r\\nReformed Protestant Dutch Church and organized a new denomination, the\\r\\nWare Hollandsch Gereformeerde Kerk.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nSimilar divisions developed in Wisconsin. Rev&amp;dot; Pieter Zoone\\r\\ninfluenced several congregations to affiliate with the Presbyterian\\r\\ndenomination. Other churches followed Van Raalte\\'s example, while still\\r\\nothers joined the newly formed Ware Hollandsch Gereformeerde Kerk. In\\r\\nOostburg, Wisconsin, one small congregation followed the advice of a lay\\r\\nminister, K&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Van Aagtekerk, and remained completely independent.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn Iowa, H&amp;dot; P&amp;dot; Scholte also remained independent, but his followers\\r\\nwere dissatisfied with that arrangement and scattered in many directions.\\r\\nWriting from Pella in 1862, John Witzenburg declared:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Now friends, I will close, for if I begin to talk about church\\r\\nlife, I won\\'t know where to stop. One claims to follow Scholte and\\r\\nanother claims to be Reformed. Still others call themselves Baptists,\\r\\nMethodists, and even something called dead-sleepers. And all this\\r\\namong intelligent people with much knowledge so that I often marvel\\r\\nhow things could have come to such errors.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nCharacterizing the situation in 1859, Maria Brandt wrote from the\\r\\nsmall Wisconsin village of Town 8, \"There is still much division among the\\r\\nHollanders in America, most of it pertaining to religion.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;A Tale of Two Denominations&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis confusing situation continued into the 1870s, but thereafter two\\r\\ndenominations attracted the loyalties of most immigrants. Van Raalte\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"114\"&gt;\\r\\nspearheaded a movement to form an ecclesiastical bond with the Reformed\\r\\nProtestant Dutch Church, known today as the Reformed Church in\\r\\nAmerica. Most of the early immigrants followed Van Raalte\\'s leadership and\\r\\njoined this church group. Originating in the seventeenth century, this\\r\\ndenomination was quite Americanized. They had adopted the English\\r\\nlanguage in worship and supported some of the revival techniques prevalent\\r\\namong the evangelical churches of America. Further, since revivals were\\r\\nessentially interdenominational efforts, the Reformed Church in America\\r\\nassociated more readily with other church groups and developed a somewhat\\r\\necumenical posture. These developments provided a comfortable situation\\r\\nfor not only the more pietistic early immigrants but also later immigrants,\\r\\nwho preferred a more rapid pace of Americanization.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nImmigrants adhering more tenaciously to the ecclesiastical patterns of\\r\\nthe Netherlands tended to join the &lt;i&gt;Ware Hollandsch Gereformeerde Kerk,&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\nknown today as the Christian Reformed Church. This denomination\\r\\ncontinued using the Dutch language in worship well into the 1930s. It has\\r\\nmaintained official connections with the &lt;i&gt;Gereformeerde Kerken&lt;/i&gt; in the\\r\\nNetherlands from 1882 to the present, and it has opposed adopting the\\r\\nrevival techniques which the immigrants frequently identified with\\r\\nMethodism.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nMany of the immigrants who were part of the second great stream of\\r\\nimmigration from the Netherlands, 1880-1920, joined the Christian\\r\\nReformed Church. The familiar language, pattern of worship, and\\r\\nconnection with the &lt;i&gt;Gereformeerde Kerk&lt;/i&gt; in the Netherlands combined to\\r\\nmake this choice attractive. Moreover, the already-established immigrants of\\r\\nthe earlier period dominated the western segment of the Reformed Church\\r\\nin America. So immigrants of the late-nineteenth century were able to\\r\\ninfluence the character of the Christian Reformed Church more readily\\r\\nthan they could influence the larger and well-established Reformed Church.\\r\\nAlso, as one might expect, social tensions developed between the older and\\r\\nnewer immigrants, and the newer immigrants maintained their identity by\\r\\njoining the Christian Reformed Church. During the decade of heaviest\\r\\nimmigration from the Netherlands (53,000 between 1880-1890), the\\r\\nmembership of the Christian Reformed Church grew from twelve thousand\\r\\nto fifty-three thousand.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn any case, during the whole period of immigration, new arrivals had\\r\\nto choose which denomination they would join. Whatever their choice, the\\r\\nimmigrants used the churches to preserve their religious convictions and\\r\\ninstruct their children along traditional lines. Thus the church and its\\r\\nminister became the crucial core of the Dutch-American community.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Church Talk&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe details of church life &amp;mdash; the coming and going of ministers,\\r\\nelection to church offices, and the building or enlargement of sanctuaries &amp;mdash;\\r\\nappeared constantly in the immigrants\\' correspondence. Perhaps some of\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"115\"&gt;\\r\\nthis \"church talk\" followed a desire to convince relatives in the Netherlands\\r\\nthat immigration had not weakened the faith. Writing directly on that point\\r\\nin 1855, Markus Nienhuis asserted, \"But you must not think that the\\r\\nworship of God is forgotten here. Oh no! I believe, in fact, that it is\\r\\nmaintained better here than in Holland.\" Few correspondents were willing\\r\\nto generalize so broadly as Nienhuis, but most of the immigrants\\r\\ncommented on the quality of their ministers and the importance of church\\r\\nconnections.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe letter of Jan Spoelstra, written shortly after his arrival in 1890,\\r\\nprovides a typical example. He said, \"We enjoy the great blessings of health,\\r\\nfood, and all our necessities, and in addition we are permitted to hear the\\r\\nprecious Word of God proclaimed each Sunday by a true servant of the\\r\\nLord.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nParticipation in church activity was always newsworthy, but\\r\\nimmigrants took special delight in reporting that their children were also\\r\\nactive church members. Klaas Niemeijer was pleased to announce that his\\r\\ndaughter, Henderika, had acquired status as a musician. He wrote, \"When\\r\\nwe have a celebration, she has to sing a solo, the first two lines of every\\r\\nverse, and then the whole class joins in. She sings surprisingly well, and she\\r\\nhas already sung four times in church.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBeing able to announce that a son or brother had become a minister\\r\\nwas probably the most newsworthy event in a Dutch-American family.\\r\\nMaartje Nieveen Smit, in Platte, South Dakota, proudly reported, \"My son,\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I45.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"116\"&gt;\\r\\nSieuwke, is now ready to be a Dominie. He has been home for three\\r\\nmonths, but now he is gone to look at a place where he received a call. It is\\r\\nmiles away. He preaches in English and has studied for nine years. But when\\r\\nhe is home, he prefers to talk Groningers with us.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlthough not quite so prestigious, the marriage of a daughter to a\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I46.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\nminister was also significant news. In that category the children of Willem\\r\\nand Jane Walvoord may have set a record. Reporting these events, the proud\\r\\nmother of the Walvoord girls wrote, \"Our oldest daughter, Drieka, who is\\r\\nmarried to Rev&amp;dot; Klerk, lives in Clymer, New York.... Dillie, who is\\r\\nmarried to Rev&amp;dot; Kuiper, lives in Cedargrove, Wisconsin. There he has the\\r\\nchurch which Klerk had before. Edith, who is married to Professor\\r\\nAnthonie Walvoord, lives in Nagasaki, Japan. There he is the head of an\\r\\nAcademie established by the RCA Foreign Mission Board. They come\\r\\nhome once in seven years.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"117\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nWhen describing their new homes, the immigrants almost invariably\\r\\nmeasured the convenience of their location in relation to the church rather\\r\\nthan to the nearest village or city. John Ebbers reported with satisfaction\\r\\nthat a new Dutch church had been organized in his neighborhood. \"There\\r\\nwas,\" he wrote, \"a Holland congregation organized on May 11 by Rev&amp;dot;\\r\\nWijngarden. It is an &lt;i&gt;afgeschijden&lt;/i&gt; church. This is just a short distance away.\\r\\nWe now have the church much closer by.\" After purchasing a farm in\\r\\nHawarden, Iowa, in 1910 Cornelia Kooiman wrote, \"When we move there,\\r\\nwe will be a half hour from church.\" In 1914 J&amp;dot; Den Hartog complained,\\r\\n\"There is a church in Laton, California, but we never go there because they\\r\\nspeak English, and I\\'m not very good at English yet. We always go to\\r\\nHanford, which is 12 miles from us. That is two hours riding, but the roads\\r\\nare good. Sometimes I go alone. The women here do that all the time.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D076\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nEnduring such inconvenience to attend a Holland church\\r\\ndemonstrates piety, but also the need for social contact with other\\r\\nimmigrants. In Fulton, Illinois, F&amp;dot; Sterenberg was able to report a nearly\\r\\nideal situation, which combined all the elements of a comfortable Dutch-American\\r\\nsettlement. In 1885 she wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We live in Fulton, Illinois, about 350 miles from brother Izaak\\r\\nin Michigan. By next spring I will have been married to Frederik\\r\\nSterenberg for 22 years. He is a Groninger &amp;mdash; and for years now he\\r\\nhas been an elder and song leader. We have a Holland congregation&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I47.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"118\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;here of about 150 families, primarily Groningers. We have a fine\\r\\nminister, and we enjoy going to church every Sunday. We live on a\\r\\nfarm about five miles from Fulton. The farm is 248 acres &amp;mdash; cropland\\r\\nand pasture. The largest crops are rye and corn. We sell the straw to\\r\\na paper mill about four miles away. Last year we bought a machine\\r\\nwhich is pulled by three horses, and it bundles the grain in sheaves. It\\r\\ncost $225 and makes the work easy for the boys. All they have to do\\r\\nis stand the sheaves up. We have 8 work horses and 2 colts, 47 beef\\r\\ncattle, 16 milk cows, and 46 pigs. When they are fat, they all go to\\r\\nChicago. That is the great cattle market and they are shipped live. In\\r\\nthe summer I don\\'t have to make butter. There is a creamery here\\r\\nwhich picks up the cream at the house &amp;mdash; and that brings in money\\r\\nevery month.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDutch-Americans consumed but little ink discussing doctrinal\\r\\ndistinctions. For the most part they simply reported that they were\\r\\nattending a Holland church. When inclined to elaborate, they usually\\r\\nargued that their particular denomination was similar to the church they\\r\\nhad attended in the Netherlands. Several immigrants gave the reasons for\\r\\ntheir specific denominational loyalty, but the points of distinction which\\r\\nthey listed were usually symptoms of Americanization rather than\\r\\ncomplicated theological issues.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I48.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"119\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D077\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nEvert Wonnink, while accounting for his church affiliation in 1872,\\r\\nwrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Now I am going to write a little about our congregation. After\\r\\ncareful consideration father and mother also joined the Reformed\\r\\nChurch of America here. This denomination is in agreement with the\\r\\nseceded church of the Netherlands in both teaching and confession.\\r\\nThe congregation consists of some 1200 members. Our minister is the\\r\\nold gray-haired Rev&amp;dot; Vander Meulen. He is 72 years old. He comes\\r\\nfrom Zeeland and was among the first seceders from the Netherlands\\r\\nState Church. Soon he will have to lay down his shepherd staff\\r\\nbecause his diminishing strength does not permit him to serve such a\\r\\nlarge congregation.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;We have catechism five times each week. We go to Sunday\\r\\nschool Wednesday evening and Sunday noons. We have about 250\\r\\nattending and 25 teachers. They teach in in both English and\\r\\nDutch &amp;mdash; whichever the students prefer. We do not have a young\\r\\npeople\\'s society here. Last week Wednesday we had a congregational\\r\\nmeeting at which we voted to call a new minister &amp;mdash; Rev&amp;dot; H&amp;dot; E&amp;dot;\\r\\nDosker from Zwolle.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D078\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nJacobus Pietersen, also writing from Grand Rapids, presented his\\r\\nreasons for selecting the &lt;i&gt;Ware Gereformeerde Kerk.&lt;/i&gt; In 1876 he wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Rev&amp;dot; Boer has been called here to be the seminary teacher. You\\r\\nhave probably heard about that by now. Boer is the first full-time\\r\\nteacher we have had in the&lt;/i&gt; Ware Gereformeerde Kerk &lt;i&gt;(Christian\\r\\nReformed Church). The RCA has been doing this for a long time.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Now that I have begun to write about the church, I imagine\\r\\nthat you don\\'t know much about our situation here, so I will give you\\r\\na little information. The RCA here is much like the big church in the\\r\\nNetherlands. The RCA is connected with many American churches.\\r\\nI\\'ve heard there are some 19 different sorts of these churches. You can\\r\\neasily understand that some of us are surprised by this. There are\\r\\nsuch special groups as Methodists, Baptists, Episcopalians and what\\r\\nnot all. Someone could name them all, but not me. But the RCA is\\r\\nconnected with them, and thus you can easily imagine that the\\r\\npreachers can preach just about anything they want. I don\\'t like that.\\r\\nIt is much too lax.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;But we, the CRC, are different. Not that we don\\'t have\\r\\ndifficulties &amp;mdash; because all kinds of people are mixed together here from\\r\\nthe 11 Netherlandic provinces. One feels this way and another wants\\r\\nsomething else. Thus there is much trouble in the congregation. The\\r\\nCRC has about 25 churches, but we don\\'t have an equal number of\\r\\nministers. That\\'s why Rev&amp;dot; Boer was appointed. He has seven\\r\\nstudents.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"120\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I49.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D079\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Two Theological Seminaries&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nRev&amp;dot; Gerrit E&amp;dot; Boer\\'s appointment as seminary professor in Grand\\r\\nRapids marked the origins of Calvin Theological Seminary. This school,\\r\\nfounded in 1876 to train the ministers of the Christian Reformed Church,\\r\\nwas the second theological school established by the nineteenth-century\\r\\nimmigrants. Western Theological Seminary in Holland, Michigan, started\\r\\ntraining ministers in 1866 and by 1869 had gained official status as a\\r\\nseminary of the Reformed Church in America. These two theological\\r\\nschools, together with their undergraduate departments, have guided the\\r\\ndenominations which gave them birth.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe older of the two institutions, Hope College and Western\\r\\nTheological Seminary, owes its existence to A&amp;dot; C&amp;dot; Van Raalte. He donated\\r\\nthe land on which the first buildings were constructed, and he negotiated\\r\\nwith synodical representatives to acquire denominational sanction and\\r\\nfinancial support for his school. Drawing upon well-trained ministers and\\r\\nteachers from the Americanized segment of the Reformed Church in\\r\\nAmerica, Van Raalte\\'s school acquired a competent teaching staff. In 1869\\r\\nRev&amp;dot; A&amp;dot; Zwemer, one of the school\\'s first students, described the institution\\r\\nfor his friend, Helenius De Cock&amp;dot; Zwemer wrote,\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;After living about six years in Rochester, New York, we have\\r\\nmoved to the colony of Holland so that I could do my preparatory\\r\\nstudies there in the Academy. During the time that I attended, John&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"121\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I50.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Van Vleck was the principal of the school and its first teacher. In my\\r\\nsecond year A&amp;dot; Thompson was appointed the second teacher. Now\\r\\nRev&amp;dot; Phelps, an American, has replaced Van Vleck and a Hollander,\\r\\nG&amp;dot; Vander Wall, is the second teacher. There are about 40 students.\\r\\nThey receive lessons in Greek, Hebrew, German, and English &amp;mdash;\\r\\nmath, chemistry, and philosophy. That is the school.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlthough Van Raalte sought teachers from the Netherlands, few were\\r\\nwilling to immigrate. Thus, throughout the whole of the nineteenth\\r\\ncentury, only five of the school\\'s instructors were immigrants. Thirteen\\r\\nothers, including all of the school\\'s presidents, were born and educated in\\r\\nAmerica. Thus the influence of American church life and education came\\r\\nquickly to Hope College and Western Theological Seminary. Still, the\\r\\ninfluence of Dutch theology remained strong throughout the century. The\\r\\nimmigrant ministers &amp;mdash; Van Raalte, Vander Meulen, Bolks, de Beij, Klijn,\\r\\nand Dosker &amp;mdash; were powerful leaders in the western segment of their\\r\\ndenomination, and they influenced the character of both their churches and\\r\\nthe seminary. All these ministers, however, were products of the &lt;i&gt;Afscheiding&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\nin the Netherlands, which, because of its pietistic character, absorbed\\r\\nAmerican pietism with little difficulty. The &lt;i&gt;Doleantie,&lt;/i&gt; with its more broadly\\r\\ncultural concept of Christianity, arrived too late to reorient the thinking of\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"122\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I51.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\nVan Raalte and his colleagues.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe Christian Reformed Church, which dates from 1857, also\\r\\noriginated under the influence of the &lt;i&gt;Afscheiding,&lt;/i&gt; but this denomination\\r\\nenjoyed its greatest period of growth after 1880. Many of its new members\\r\\nwere immigrants who came from the &lt;i&gt;Gereformeerde Kerken&lt;/i&gt; in the\\r\\nNetherlands. By joining the Christian Reformed Church in such large\\r\\nnumbers, they substantially altered its character. They also encouraged\\r\\nchanges in the quality of its seminary. Founded in 1876, Calvin Theological\\r\\nSeminary came quickly under Abraham Kuyper\\'s influence. Throughout the\\r\\nnineteenth century the school drew its instructors from the Netherlands.\\r\\nThe first four professors were trained at Kampen and emphasized the\\r\\ndoctrinal concerns of the &lt;i&gt;Afscheiding.&lt;/i&gt; But Geerhardus Vos, who came to the\\r\\nschool in 1890, carried fresh ideas to Grand Rapids. He had developed\\r\\nstrong attachments to Abraham Kuyper while studying in the Netherlands,\\r\\nand became Kuyper\\'s American spokesman. The introduction of Kuyperian\\r\\nprinciples caused considerable controversy in the seminary and church. The\\r\\nolder ministers, L&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Hulst, G&amp;dot; Boer, W&amp;dot; Hemkes, and F&amp;dot; Ten Hoor, resisted\\r\\nthis new infusion of Dutch theology.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D080\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;Abraham Kuyper: Influence from Abroad&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nRev&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Vander Mey, who studied under Geerhardus Vos, wrote a letter\\r\\nto Abraham Kuyper in 1896, paying tribute to his intellectual father:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Almost all the ministers of our church who were educated in\\r\\nAmerica embrace your principles. This has two causes. First, the\\r\\neducation under Boer and Hemkes was in every sense poor. After the\\r\\ngraduates became ministers, they felt the lack of sound knowledge,\\r\\nand when they entered their congregations, they tried to improve&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"123\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;themselves through continued study. And what did they use? They\\r\\nused the works of Abraham Kuyper! Secondly, those who were\\r\\neducated by Dr&amp;dot; Geerhardus Vos have come to your side as a\\r\\nconsequence of the powerful training they enjoyed under Dr&amp;dot; Vos&amp;dot; Dr&amp;dot;\\r\\nVos led us to Dr&amp;dot; Kuyper.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I also acquired my training from Dr&amp;dot; Vos&amp;dot; Thus, I too have\\r\\nbecome an admirer of Dr&amp;dot; Kuyper. Please excuse me, dear teacher,\\r\\nthat I proclaim my inner feelings to you. I can never tell you how\\r\\nlarge a place you occupy in my heart. But, how can it be otherwise? I\\r\\nread almost everything you write.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAs Vander Mey\\'s letter suggests, many of the older ministers schooled\\r\\nat Kampen rejected the new views, but in the long run Kuyper\\'s influence\\r\\nprevailed. Although G&amp;dot; Vos left Grand Rapids to join the theological\\r\\nseminary of Princeton in New Jersey, many students followed him to receive\\r\\npost-graduate instruction. Many others traveled to the Netherlands and\\r\\nattended the Free University of Amsterdam. Between 1902 and 1948 twelve\\r\\ninstructors were appointed to the faculty of Calvin Seminary; and all but\\r\\none of these attended the Free University or Princeton, where Geerhardus\\r\\nVos continued teaching until 1932. Thus Abraham Kuyper did not lack\\r\\ndisciples in the New World. Nor were his admirers confined to the\\r\\nChristian Reformed Church.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D081\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"letter\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNicholas M&amp;dot; Steffens, a professor at Western Theological Seminary in\\r\\nHolland, Michigan, also supported Kuyperian ideas. He maintained\\r\\nconnections with G&amp;dot; Vos in Grand Rapids and corresponded frequently with\\r\\nAbraham Kuyper. Both Steffens and Vos had difficulty persuading their\\r\\ncolleagues to adopt Kuyperian views. Writing to Kuyper about this problem\\r\\nin 1891, Steffens said:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Dr&amp;dot; Vos has a more conservative surrounding than I, but he is\\r\\nunderstood by his colleagues &amp;mdash; even though these well-meaning people\\r\\nare poorly educated and narrow minded. Momentarily Vos is plagued\\r\\nin the Wachter because of his supralapsarian viewpoint. Actually,\\r\\nRev&amp;dot; Hulst is not concerned with Vos\\'s views, but he uses Vos to\\r\\nattack you. It is a pity that the young man, Vos, wastes his power in\\r\\nsuch a place. Had he stayed in the Netherlands, he could have\\r\\ncontributed much more. He is no leader of public affairs, but he is\\r\\nconscientious and works diligently. There is nothing but praise to be\\r\\nsaid for his principles. I love him.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nOf his own circumstances, Steffens wrote:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Even our own paper,&lt;/i&gt; The Hope, &lt;i&gt;is in the hands of a clique\\r\\nwhich does everything to prevent me from explaining Reformed\\r\\nprinciples. I have a group of articles in my file which have been\\r\\nrejected by the editorial committee. Sometimes I don\\'t know what to\\r\\ndo. It is obvious that here in this \"free\" America, you can find&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"124\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;tyranny which opposes the work of the Lord.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn general Steffens regarded the American setting as inhospitable to\\r\\nReformed and Kuyperian influences. Apparently A&amp;dot; Kuyper considered the\\r\\npossibility of leading a group of immigrants to America in the 1880s, but\\r\\nSteffens advised strenuously against this:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I can understand how you may think that it might be better to\\r\\nlead your Reformed people to Africa or North America, but don\\'t\\r\\ngive it serious thought. There is little in America to offer hope, even\\r\\nthough I would personally love to have you and your people among\\r\\nus.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I know the strife is fierce, but you have a better prospect for\\r\\nsuccess in the Netherlands than here in America. We are on a path\\r\\nhere which you would have to struggle against.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;I say it confidentially, but it is true, that in the Presbyterian\\r\\nand Reformed Churches of America the modern and conciliatory\\r\\nspirit is spreading quickly. When you try to oppose this spirit, the\\r\\ncolumns of the newspapers are closed to you. Not long ago I\\r\\nattempted to get something printed in the&lt;/i&gt; New York Observer &lt;i&gt;in an\\r\\neffort to oppose the violation of the doctrine of justification by faith\\r\\ncaused by the new evangelical methods, but the door was closed.\\r\\nThus it is so, that as foreigners, the Hollanders can exercise little\\r\\ninfluence over the theological developments of the nation. They are\\r\\neither lost within the nation, or they remain strangers &amp;mdash; protesting\\r\\nagainst all things American.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nPerceptively, Steffens raised the central issue facing all immigrant\\r\\ngroups in America, and among Dutch-Americans the debate over\\r\\nAmericanization has continued to the present. Vander Mey expressed the\\r\\nnature of that dilemma with exceptional clarity. Writing to A&amp;dot; Kuyper in\\r\\n1896, Vander Mey complained:\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;As Reformed Christians we face a dark future here in America.\\r\\nPeople in the Netherlands have no idea how the whole of America\\r\\ndrinks from the fountains of Methodism, and the young people in our\\r\\nchurch also lean in that direction. We scarcely know how to preserve\\r\\nthem. If, as many prefer, we choose to remain isolated as Hollanders,\\r\\nwe will be signing our own death warrants. But the other option &amp;mdash;\\r\\nswift Americanization &amp;mdash; often results in more disastrous\\r\\nconsequences.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/bl&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDutch Americans have found no single answer to Vander Mey\\'s\\r\\ndilemma, but with varying success they have attempted to retain what they\\r\\nconsider best in their ethnic tradition. Among those whose Netherlandic\\r\\nroots are most directly connected with the &lt;i&gt;Afscheiding&lt;/i&gt; of the 1830s,\\r\\nAmericanization is more complete. For these Dutch-Americans the church\\r\\nconstitutes the most direct link with an ethnic past. But, as we have seen,\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"125\"&gt;\\r\\nthe &lt;i&gt;Afscheiding&lt;/i&gt; was a simpler and more narrow interpretation of Christian\\r\\nlife than was the &lt;i&gt;Doleantie.&lt;/i&gt; Thus the &lt;i&gt;Afscheiding,&lt;/i&gt; with its concern for piety\\r\\nand pure doctrine, could more readily adapt to American society. The\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Afgescheidenen&lt;/i&gt; were also among the earliest immigrants, and their\\r\\ndescendants have had more time to adjust their views to the American\\r\\ncontext.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDutch immigrants attached to the &lt;i&gt;Doleantie&lt;/i&gt; have approached the\\r\\nproblem of Americanization more aggressively than those who arrived\\r\\nbefore the 1880s. Although willing to join American society, many of\\r\\nAbraham Kuyper\\'s followers hoped to influence the institutions of North\\r\\nAmerica by establishing separate schools, labor unions, political parties,\\r\\nand newspapers. They believed that Christians outside of the Dutch-American\\r\\ncommunity could be attracted to these institutions. But, aside\\r\\nfrom the Christian school, these efforts have enjoyed small success.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe Christian school, however, has continued to grow, supported by\\r\\nboth a Holland and a general American constituency. Christian Schools\\r\\nInternational, an organization that encompasses more than three hundred\\r\\nschools and more than sixty thousand students, has attempted to preserve\\r\\npart of the Kuyperian view in American society. Staffed primarily by\\r\\ngraduates of Dutch-American colleges, the Christian schools attempt to\\r\\nlead successive generations along paths that originate from both the\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Afscheiding&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Doleantie.&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThis dual tradition has been the source of some tension in the Dutch-American\\r\\ncommunity. The western congregations of the Reformed Church\\r\\nin America, those that originated in Van Raalte\\'s era, have emphasized\\r\\npersonal piety and doctrinal purity more than the eastern segment of the\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I52.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"126\"&gt;\\r\\ndenomination; while the doctrinal-pietistic traditions of the Christian\\r\\nReformed Church have blunted the influence of Abraham Kuyper\\'s\\r\\nDoleantie. Additional complications have arisen from the American\\r\\ncontext in which those churches have developed. Nonetheless, both\\r\\ndenominations continue to bear the clear imprint of their Netherlandic\\r\\norigins.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;part id=\"S9831-D082\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;div3 name=\"\" type=\"editorial\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;b&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/b&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/head&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nFor rather obvious reasons nineteenth-century Holland-American\\r\\nimmigrants have experienced relatively few difficulties in their adopted land.\\r\\nFirst, they were northern Europeans whose appearance and general values\\r\\ndiffered little from the dominant Anglo-American cultural establishment.\\r\\nEven more significantly, Netherlanders had been present in North America\\r\\nsince the early seventeenth century, and their descendants made the\\r\\nnewcomers less conspicuous. These new immigrants also benefited from the\\r\\ntradition of acceptability and the achievements established by their\\r\\nseventeenth-century forerunners. Further, because their names were easily\\r\\nconfused with those of the original Dutch families, they acquired some of\\r\\nthe prestige which the older families enjoyed as founders and original\\r\\nsettlers.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn the United States only the English enjoyed similarly prestigious\\r\\norigins. The Spanish and French were less acceptable because of their\\r\\nCatholicism, and all other large groups of Europeans arrived after the\\r\\nAnglo-American patterns had been established. By contrast, Netherlanders\\r\\nhad preceded many English colonists, and the Dutch created their own\\r\\ncultural hegemony in New Amsterdam. Even after the English captured the\\r\\nDutch colony in 1664, immigrants arriving in that area frequently\\r\\nconformed to the Netherlandic cultural setting. Swedes, Germans, and even\\r\\nsome of the English were forced to adopt the Dutch language in order to\\r\\nconduct business. As late as the 1840s, when the \"new\" immigration began,\\r\\nfresh arrivals easily encountered Dutch-speaking guides and advisers in New\\r\\nYork and New Jersey.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nAlong with all these advantages Holland-Americans constituted so\\r\\nsmall a minority in North America that they never threatened an already-established\\r\\ncultural pattern. By contrast, the Irish entered Boston in such\\r\\nlarge numbers that they threatened and eventually captured political power\\r\\nfrom the old Anglo-American elite. Nineteenth-century Holland-Americans\\r\\ndid dominate whole regions of Michigan, Iowa, and elsewhere,\\r\\nbut they generally acquired open or sparsely populated districts, thus\\r\\nreducing the potential for cultural clash and competition.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHolland-Americans have resisted total Americanization by choice and\\r\\nnot because they were unwelcome in the centers of American life. In fact, it\\r\\nhas been easy for Dutch-Americans to drift into the mainstream of\\r\\nAmerican culture because they have always been there. Names like De\\r\\nVries, Roosevelt, Vander Bilt, and De Witt were common and frequently\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"127\"&gt;\\r\\nprestigious when the nineteenth-century immigration began. While Poles,\\r\\nItalians, and Jews have been tempted to Anglicize their names to gain\\r\\nacceptance in American society, Hollanders have felt little pressure in that\\r\\ndirection. Peter De Vries, a best-selling American novelist, but also the son\\r\\nof a nineteenth-century immigrant, has utilized the confusion connected\\r\\nwith distinguishing the \"old\" Dutch families from the \"new\" to create a\\r\\ndelightful scene in his novel, &lt;i&gt;The Blood of the Lamb.&lt;/i&gt; In this somewhat\\r\\nautobiographical story, De Vries, thinly veiled as the main character,\\r\\nWanderhope, crashes high American social circles in Chicago because the\\r\\n\"Americans\" easily confuse his name with those of the New York elite.\\r\\nWhen the Chicago socialite Mrs&amp;dot; Winkler asks, \"Have you ever been\\r\\nabroad?\" Wanderhope answers, \"No, but my parents have. They\\'ve spent\\r\\nmany years in Europe.\" And, of course, before emigrating to Chicago,\\r\\nwhere he became a garbage collector, De Vries\\'s father had indeed spent\\r\\n\"many years in Europe.\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt is true that Dutch family names often appear in lists of prestigious\\r\\nAmericans; virtually every chronicler of Dutch-American history will cite\\r\\nthe three Presidents Martin Van Buren, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin\\r\\nD&amp;dot; Roosevelt, together with Senator Arthur Vanden Berg. And books like\\r\\n&lt;i&gt;Hollanders Who Helped Build America&lt;/i&gt; (1942), by H&amp;dot; M&amp;dot; Viekke and H&amp;dot;\\r\\nBeets,&lt;note ref=\"3\"&gt;3 &lt;i&gt;This book contains biographical sketches for more than five hundred living Dutch-Americans.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt; demonstrate that Holland-Americans have become prominent\\r\\nmembers of every profession in America. But it is difficult to determine\\r\\nwhat degree of ethnic consciousness these people have retained; the specific\\r\\ncharacter of their contributions seldom bears a direct relationship to their\\r\\nnational origin.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nHolland-Americans have probably had the strongest influence on\\r\\nAmerican culture in the are of religious affairs. In the long run, for\\r\\nexample, the influence of the immigrant preacher T&amp;dot; J&amp;dot; Frelinghuysen has\\r\\nbeen vastly greater than that of Governor Peter Stuyvesant. As a principal\\r\\ninitiator of the religious movement known as the Great Awakening\\r\\n(1720-1760), Frelinghuysen, who carried his pietism from the Netherlands,\\r\\nused it to influence the character of the American religious revival. The\\r\\nconsequences of that influence can be readily observed in the activity of\\r\\nBilly Graham.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe impact of the nineteenth-century immigration remains less clear;\\r\\nbut because they occupy identifiable regions in Michigan, Iowa, and\\r\\nelsewhere, these Holland-Americans have preserved a sufficient level of\\r\\nethnic identity to influence the larger American community. Still, aside\\r\\nfrom a few isolated cases, the success of prominent individuals usually stems\\r\\nfrom that person\\'s activity as an American rather than as a Dutch-American.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBy contrast, institutions frequently preserve pure ethnic traits.\\r\\nChurches, schools, hospitals, and homes for the aged, which spring from\\r\\nand support the ethnic family and its values, are able to enlarge a small\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"128\"&gt;\\r\\n&lt;figure inline=\"y\" sysid=\"S9831-I53.jpg\" link=\"nolink\" ref=\"image\"&gt;\\r\\ncommunity\\'s sphere of influence more effectively than the ordinary\\r\\nindividual can. For example, an educational institution like Calvin College\\r\\nin Grand Rapids, Michigan, has already provided leadership among other\\r\\nchurch-related schools who reject the views of our post-Christian world but\\r\\nwish for more than mere survival through isolation. It is the influence of\\r\\nAbraham Kuyper\\'s &lt;i&gt;Doleantie&lt;/i&gt; which has strengthened the capacity of Calvin\\r\\nCollege to provide leadership in examining the cultural dimensions of\\r\\nChristianity in America.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIn recent years the growth potential for ethnic survival in the United\\r\\nStates has increased. Although the causes of this development are not easily\\r\\nidentified, they relate to a general lack of self-confidence in the centers of\\r\\nAmerican power and influence. Problems (the riots in the 1960s, the\\r\\nVietnam War, and political corruption) have forced many opinion leaders to\\r\\nreconsider their faith in progress, because the foundation of that faith seems\\r\\nless secure. First, the supposedly unlimited supply of cheap raw material,\\r\\nupon which America\\'s wide-spread consumer economy depends, seems to be\\r\\ndwindling. Up to this moment no technological \"miracle\" has appeared to\\r\\nsignificantly alter the source or amount of available energy which feeds the\\r\\nconsumption ethos. Also, it has become increasingly evident that the\\r\\ninstitutions of democracy have not improved either the moral or intellectual\\r\\nqualities of the populace and its leaders.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nNaive though it may seem, the American Dream has been built upon\\r\\nthe twin foundations of economic and moral progress. The keystone of this\\r\\nedifice has been the public schools, which were urged to draw all people &amp;mdash;\\r\\nblack and white; Protestant, Catholic, and Jew &amp;mdash; into a great melting pot.\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"129\"&gt;\\r\\nFrom this crucible educational leaders hoped to forge a new humanity whose\\r\\ncommon faith in the ideals and institutions of democracy would transcend\\r\\nall ethnic and religious difference. The rewards of this new faith were socio-economic\\r\\nadvancement, and those who believed and lived in accord with\\r\\nthe \"American Way\" were promised success.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nDuring the past two centuries many European immigrants have been\\r\\neconomically successful. They have become landowners and homeowners,\\r\\nand their children have progressed to careers in business and well-paid\\r\\nprofessions. But the potential for continued advancement of this sort seems\\r\\nto be clogging up. Hard work no longer leads automatically to improved\\r\\nliving standards. Diplomas do not insure entrance into desired professions.\\r\\nMore significantly still, those who have succeeded often find the\\r\\nmeaninglessness of their lives a source of discontent.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nIt seems probable that the cause of this disillusionment rests upon the\\r\\nrelatively scant cultural tapestry offered in the American Dream. By\\r\\nconcentrating the core of American values in political theories born in the\\r\\neighteenth century, by defining social status within the narrow band of\\r\\nmaterial consumption, American culture has offered too little substance for\\r\\nhuman satisfaction or fulfillment. One compensatory reaction to these\\r\\nlimited cultural currents may be an intensified adherence to ethnic values\\r\\nand traditions &amp;mdash; a phenomenon which many American scholars and\\r\\njournalists have discussed recently.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe research of three prominent authors (D&amp;dot; P&amp;dot; Moynihan, J&amp;dot;\\r\\nHigham, and M&amp;dot; Gordon&lt;note ref=\"4\"&gt;4 &lt;i&gt;Daniel P&amp;dot; Moynihan and Nathan Glazer,&lt;/i&gt; Beyond The Melting Pot &lt;i&gt;(Cambridge, Mass&amp;dot;: M&amp;dot;I&amp;dot;T&amp;dot;\\r\\nPress, 1963); Milton Gordon,&lt;/i&gt; Assimilation in American Life &lt;i&gt;(New York: Oxford Univ&amp;dot; Press,\\r\\n1968); John Higham,&lt;/i&gt; Send Me These &lt;i&gt;(New York: Athenium, 1975).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt;) has confirmed the suspicion that the melting\\r\\npot formula has not dissolved America\\'s ethnic groups and that the\\r\\nimmigrants and their descendants have maintained loyalties to both their\\r\\nEuropean and American traditions. Thus, the prospect of a continuing and\\r\\nvital ethnic awareness remains strong.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nBut more recently, in the 1980\\'s, the astounding growth of the\\r\\nHispanic-American community (currently about 23 million) has rekindled\\r\\ndemands for cultural conformity.&lt;note ref=\"5\"&gt;5 &lt;i&gt;Rudolph Vercoli \"The Return of the Melting Pot: Ethnicity in the United States in the Eighties.\"&lt;/i&gt;\\r\\nJournal of the American Ethnic History, &lt;i&gt;Fall 1985, pages 9-19.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/note&gt; It is doubtful, though, that the general\\r\\ninterest in ethnic studies will give way to the extreme pressure for cultural\\r\\nconformity which prevailed between 1917 and 1950. Cultural pluralism will\\r\\nprobably continue to flourish as a balancing force to cultural homogeneity.\\r\\nIn any case each generation of Americans has been inclined to reexamine\\r\\nthe age-old question \"What is an American?\"\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;p&gt;\\r\\nThe answer to that query has never been static because the populace\\r\\nhas been in constant fluctuation. But, by merely raising the question, fresh\\r\\n&lt;page n=\"130\"&gt;\\r\\nconsiderations arise. Among those is the possibility that America is and\\r\\nmust continue to be a pluralistic society composed of ethnic groups who can\\r\\nmake their best contributions to the general welfare by maintaining some\\r\\nnon-American values and traditions. If this is a viable model for American\\r\\nlife, the Holland-American community deserves careful scrutiny; it has\\r\\nstaked out a remarkably large territory for the continued cultivation of its\\r\\nethnic heritage.\\r\\n&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/part&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div3&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div2&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/div1&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/text&gt;\\r\\n&lt;/lad&gt;\\r\\n\\r\\n'"

The English, Spanish, and Netherlanders who explored the\\r\\nregion came first. They established trading centers such as New\\r\\nAmsterdam and Boston on the fringes of the continent during the\\r\\nseventeenth century.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSince that time &mdash; in fact, since Henry Hudson's exploration in 1609 &mdash;\\r\\nNetherlanders have had continuous connection with North America. New\\r\\nNetherlands, the colony the Dutch founded in 1615, survived until the\\r\\nBritish conquest of 1664. At that time about seven thousand Netherlanders\\r\\nlived in New Amsterdam and the surrounding area. Few new immigrants\\r\\nfrom the mother country joined them until the nineteenth century, when\\r\\nthe most massive population migration in modern times occurred.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBetween 1820 and 1920 more than thirty million Europeans\\r\\nimmigrated to the United States, but of these less than 1 percent were\\r\\nNetherlanders. Unlike the Irish, Germans, and others, the Netherlanders\\r\\ndid not desert their homeland in frenzied massive waves. The first\\r\\nsignificant emigration, guided by A&dot; C&dot; Van Raalte, H&dot; P&dot; Scholte, and C&dot;\\r\\nVander Meulen, was planned with great care. And after arriving in\\r\\nAmerica, these first immigrants mailed detailed reports of their experience\\r\\nto families and friends in the mother country. These letters indicate that few\\r\\nimmigrants from Holland entered the New World blindly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn 1846, the year that A&dot; C&dot; Van Raalte led a group of emigrants from\\r\\nArnhem to Michigan, emigration from the Netherlands totaled about two\\r\\nthousand. That same year fifty thousand Germans migrated to North\\r\\nAmerica. Many of these passed through the Netherlands en route to\\r\\n<page n=\\\"10\\\">\\r\\nRotterdam and Amsterdam, and some arrived on the Dutch coast without\\r\\nenough money to pay for their passage. They became dependents of the\\r\\nDutch government. Trekking along the roads and rivers of Holland, the\\r\\nGerman migrants sparked considerable interest among the poor folk in the\\r\\nNetherlands, but few actually joined the German throng.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAfter the reports from the followers of Van Raalte, Scholte, and others\\r\\nreached the Netherlands, the people began to emigrate in larger numbers,\\r\\nand between 1881 and 1890 that movement peaked at 53,701. Thus, even\\r\\nduring its crest, emigration from the Netherlands was miniscule compared\\r\\nto the movement from Germany, Poland, and elsewhere.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAmericans, whatever their country of origin, retain a lingering but\\r\\nvague acquaintance with the events surrounding the immigration of their\\r\\nancestors. Tales of hardship, followed by success or disappointment, abound.\\r\\nIn recent years many third- and fourth-generation Americans have become\\r\\nnewly interested in the details of the immigration experience. Although this\\r\\nnew concern may have arisen in reaction to black chauvinism in the 1960s,\\r\\nit has developed into a positive force encouraged and supported by the\\r\\nnational government. \\\"Ethnic Studies\\\" have become popular in the schools\\r\\nand bookstores of America.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo encourage this interest in national origins, the Bentley Historical\\r\\nLibrary of the University of Michigan sent scholars to Europe in search of\\r\\nthe correspondence written by the immigrants of the last century. While\\r\\nother historians investigated the archives of Ireland, Finland, and Poland, I\\r\\nreceived financial assistance enabling me to locate letters written by\\r\\nemigrants from the Netherlands. During six months in 1976, I was able to\\r\\nlocate and photocopy about 1,400 immigrant letters. Some of these letters\\r\\nwere publicly available prior to my search; but I discovered a majority of this\\r\\ncorrespondence in the attics, cupboards, and bookshelves of private homes\\r\\nand farms. Until now, these pages have not been available for public\\r\\nexamination.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDiscovering these letters was a great adventure that led me to\\r\\nhundreds of cities and villages in the Netherlands. Throughout the process I\\r\\nenjoyed help and encouragement from many people in Holland.\\r\\nExperiencing their open-hearted hospitality was an exceptional pleasure.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLike many other Americans, I have always been aware of my ethnic\\r\\nheritage, and as a historian I have read most of the available literature on\\r\\nDutch-American history. But the experience of living and working among\\r\\nthe people who embody my own European heritage has enriched the\\r\\nmeaning of my study. One hundred and four years after my great-grandfather\\r\\nimmigrated from Drenthe, I was able to visit his birthplace, walk the streets\\r\\nof his youth, and meet the descendants of his neighbors. No book,\\r\\nphotograph, or motion picture can equal the intimacy and satisfaction of\\r\\nthat experience.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHistorians use many sources in their attempts to recreate the past.\\r\\nSome of these, such as minutes of organizations and governmental reports,\\r\\n<page n=\\\"11\\\">\\r\\nyield a rich harvest of data but lack lively human qualities and often reduce\\r\\nthe vitality of experience to relatively bloodless generalizations. I believe\\r\\nthat the letters the immigrants wrote constitute the best source for\\r\\nrediscovering the spirit and character of the immigration.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis book attempts to provide some essential background for the\\r\\nletters, while allowing the immigrants to speak for themselves. Thus, the\\r\\nscope of this story is circumscribed by the availability of immigrant\\r\\ncorrespondence. Fortunately, I was able to discover letters from every major\\r\\nDutch-American settlement in the United States. But for some localities,\\r\\nparticularly New Jersey, a larger number of letters would have been\\r\\ndesirable. In any case, the correspondence portrays the full range of\\r\\nimmigrant experience: ocean travel, wilderness beginnings, life in the cities,\\r\\nand the formation of distinctly Dutch-American institutions in a foreign\\r\\nland. Through all this the immigrants remained deeply interested in the\\r\\nland of their birth. Their correspondence illustrates the validity of a proverb\\r\\nthey often cited, \\\"Het bloed kruipt waar het niet gaan kan.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhile acquiring the letters which constitute the heart of this book, I\\r\\nhave accumulated a mountain of debt &mdash; that is, I owe gratitude to literally\\r\\ndozens of Netherlanders. I wish to express appreciation particularly to\\r\\nseveral very helpful friends. No one gave me more time, sound advice, and\\r\\ndelightful companionship than the late Mr&dot; G&dot; H&dot; Ligterink. Together we\\r\\ntraveled the small roads of the <i>achterhoek</i> and visited dozens of families.\\r\\nFrom them we acquired many of the most interesting letters in this\\r\\ncollection. Professor H&dot; J&dot; Prakke and Mr&dot; G&dot; J&dot; H&dot; Kroessenbrink arranged\\r\\na fruitful newspaper and radio publicity for my search. Others, such as G&dot;\\r\\nBrands, Jr&dot; and J&dot; G&dot; Ter Horst, arranged meetings and spoke for me when I\\r\\nconfronted dialects too complicated for my limited language skills. Just over\\r\\nthe border in Bentheim, the Gerhard Hensen family assisted me generously.\\r\\nWhile in Drenthe, the pleasant hours and letters I shared with the late J&dot; S&dot;\\r\\nWilting remain precious to me. J&dot; A&dot; Niemeijer, who led me to a publisher\\r\\nand the hospitality of his home, will always remain my friend. Our\\r\\nneighbors in Heerde, Mr&dot; and Mrs&dot; Jan Driesten, provided valuable\\r\\nassistance to me, but even more important, they gave their hearts and\\r\\nhands to me and my family. To all of these I wish to express deep\\r\\nappreciation.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThroughout the Netherlands, from Middelburg to Leeuwarden,\\r\\narchivists and librarians provided helpful assistance and sound advice. At\\r\\nthe Free University, Dr&dot; Peter Hoekstra was extraordinarily helpful.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the United States, the Calvin Seminary Librarian, Peter De Klerk,\\r\\nand the late Mr&dot; George Kamp graciously provided editorial assistance. I\\r\\nreceived financial support from Calvin College, the Earhart Foundation,\\r\\nand the University of Michigan. The assistance of these institutions allowed\\r\\nme to devote a full year to the efforts represented in this book.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"[12]\\\">\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I01.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div2>\\r\\n</div1>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"13\\\">\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D002\\\">\\r\\n<div1 name=\\\"Body\\\" type=\\\"body\\\">\\r\\n<div2 name=\\\"Chapter 1 Crossing the Atlantic\\\" type=\\\"chapter\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"editorial\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>N</b>orth America, the destination of some 250,000 Netherlanders\\r\\nbetween 1840 and 1920, has often been called the Promised\\r\\nLand. Pious immigrants used this biblical metaphor with little\\r\\nhesitation. Even the not-so-pious Thomas Jefferson designed\\r\\nan official seal for the United States which depicted the children of Israel\\r\\ncrossing the Red Sea. And it's not difficult to understand why: crossing the\\r\\nAtlantic was a universal experience among European immigrants, and for\\r\\nmany of them the perils of the passage easily suggested the Jewish Exodus.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>Leaders and Routes</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAlthough Holland-Americans had no single Moses, a number of\\r\\nreligious leaders did organize large groups of emigrants and guide them to\\r\\nNorth America. Rev&dot; A&dot; C&dot; Van Raalte directed the first band of\\r\\napproximately one thousand emigrants on a 4,000-mile trek which began in\\r\\nArnhem and ended in the Michigan wilderness. Rev&dot; H&dot; P&dot; Scholte\\r\\nchartered three ships to transport nine hundred of his followers to\\r\\nBaltimore; from there they traveled inland to the prairies of Iowa. From\\r\\nZeeland, Rev&dot; C&dot; Vander Meulen joined his people on a thirty-three-day\\r\\nvoyage that ended in New York.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSmaller groups followed similar patterns. Rev&dot; M&dot; S&dot; Ypma left\\r\\nFriesland with about fifty followers; after arriving in New York, the group\\r\\ntraveled to western Michigan, where they organized the village of Vriesland.\\r\\nTogether with a majority of his parishioners in Hellendoorn, Rev&dot; S&dot; Bolks\\r\\nsailed from Rotterdam and eventually followed Van Raalte to western\\r\\nMichigan. There Bolks founded the village of Overisel.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"14\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMost of these early emigrants chartered whole vessels and sailed\\r\\ndirectly from Dutch harbors to American ports. Several of the first ships\\r\\nsailed to New Orleans, expecting to avoid overland travel in America by\\r\\nfollowing the Mississippi River northward; but they quickly discovered that\\r\\nthe swift current of the Mississippi hindered rapid travel. Thereafter most\\r\\nemigrants sailed directly to harbors on the Eastern seaboard. Of these, New\\r\\nYork was favored because it provided ready access to the Erie Canal, which\\r\\nled to Buffalo, New York. From that point the immigrants could obtain\\r\\ntransportation on the Great Lakes to ports in Michigan, Illinois, and\\r\\nWisconsin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nEmigrants traveling singly or in small groups obviously could not\\r\\ncharter whole ships. So many of these travelers crossed the English Channel\\r\\nand took trains overland from Hull to Liverpool. There they joined\\r\\nemigrants from all over Europe and booked passage for North America.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D003\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>Travel Tales</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSince sailing the Atlantic was one of the most fearful aspects of\\r\\nemigration, correspondents frequently related this experience in great\\r\\ndetail. In 1846 Hendrich Barendregt traveled to New Orleans and\\r\\ninvestigated that route for Rev&dot; H&dot; P&dot; Scholte. Reporting to his family in\\r\\n`s Gravendeel, Barendregt wrote:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>The passage was certainly full of novelty and excitement; I had\\r\\nnever imagined that such a huge ship could be tossed about by the\\r\\nwaves in such a frightening manner. Many times I could not walk so\\r\\nmuch as four or five feet without using two hands to prevent myself\\r\\nfrom falling. This has strengthened me remarkably. Of the whole 180\\r\\npassengers probably but 10 were not seasick, and I was fortunate\\r\\nenough to be among them. On one occasion a huge wave crashed\\r\\nthrough the large hatch; I was soaking wet and my wife, who was\\r\\nalready in bed, was thoroughly drenched. Although I held up well\\r\\nthroughout the trip, at that moment I thought we would be drowned.\\r\\nBut the Lord does all things for our good. We didn't experience\\r\\nanything of special note: eight women gave birth during the voyage\\r\\nwithout help from a doctor or nurse. Of these newborn, two died\\r\\nalong with two other children and an old woman. Thus five died.\\r\\nWhen we came to New Orleans, we sailed up the Mississippi by\\r\\nsteamboat to St&dot; Louis.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Imagine, the distance between New Orleans and St&dot; Louis is\\r\\n500 miles, a trip which took us nine days, all the while traveling amid\\r\\nthe forests. At this point the river is about as wide as the kil in your\\r\\nneighborhood. They cannot use sailing ships here because the current\\r\\nis always strong, and they can't pull the ships with ropes and horses\\r\\nbecause the banks are covered with trees.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"15\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt need hardly be mentioned that travel in the mid-nineteenth\\r\\ncentury required more planning and endurance than it does today. Naturally\\r\\nthe experience of the trans-Atlantic crossing varied a great deal. Rev&dot; H&dot; P&dot;\\r\\nScholte, who was not financially restricted, chartered passage on the\\r\\nsteamship <i>Sarah Sands,</i> and completed the voyage from Liverpool in just\\r\\nthirteen days, while Rev&dot; A&dot; C&dot; Van Raalte, who sailed on the three-masted\\r\\n<i>Southerner</i> in 1846, remained at sea for fifty-four days.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMany immigrants complained of cramped quarters, poor food, and\\r\\nseasickness.

We lost sight of the Dutch coast finally at\\r\\n10:00... truly an important moment. Further it was continuously\\r\\nwet weather and we came to the tempestuous North Sea. In a short\\r\\ntime everyone was so seasick that they vomited like\\r\\nherons.... Towards evening the seasickness let up and everyone\\r\\ntried to rest their wet bodies, not knowing what we were about to\\r\\nencounter. Still, God knows everything and cares for all things. We\\r\\nsailed nicely until about ten in the evening when suddenly we\\r\\nstopped. The whistles and alarms sounded. We did not yet know what\\r\\nall the commotion was about. We moved slowly forward until\\r\\nsuddenly a great shock came which awakened everyone. Then the\\r\\nwater came pouring into the ship. What wailing! What noise! Death\\r\\nstood before everyone's eyes. Anguished screams, impossible to\\r\\ndescribe, rose from the multitude. Mothers mourned their children,\\r\\nhusbands their wives, and wives their husbands. It was a confusing\\r\\nspectacle. It was God, however, who foresaw our need and he saved\\r\\nus by means of weak human hands. To Him be thanks!</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Everyone climbed on deck to look for help. The sailors were\\r\\nbusy trying to make all possibilities of salvation ready. A French boat,\\r\\nnamed the</i> Frankland, <i>came directly alongside of us, but the fog was\\r\\nso thick that it was difficult to tie up with each other. Soon the</i>\\r\\nFrankland <i>was ready to take the people from our ship on board. Our\\r\\nship was sinking so quickly that the passengers stood in water up to\\r\\ntheir knees and their arms, but God kept the water below their lips.\\r\\nEveryone was brought over to the other boat &mdash; no one remained.

There are many\\r\\nHollanders there who can instruct you in everything. With God's\\r\\nblessing you can earn a great amount of money there. If you intend to\\r\\ncome to America, make certain that you provide yourselves with\\r\\nwoolen clothing, linen and woolen yard goods. Cotton is no more\\r\\nexpensive here than by you. Also, bring a spinning wheel and a clock.\\r\\nClocks here are cheap, but of poor quality. Tobacco here is both\\r\\nexpensive and poor.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>To get ready for ocean travel prepare yourself with potatoes,\\r\\nbuckwheat flour, beans, dried meat and bacon, pepper, salt, vinegar,\\r\\ncoffee, and especially tea. You have many difficulties to attend on the\\r\\ntrip. In the city from which you depart, buy a small vat of salted fish.\\r\\nMake sure that you buy another small vat with a spigot which you\\r\\nmust use to get your daily supply of water, and fill it before you leave.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"22\\\">\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D010\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nRoelof Brinks, whose mother hoped he would return to the\\r\\nNetherlands and bring her to Michigan, offered explicit advice to both his\\r\\nmother and brother.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Mother, you want me to bring you here too, and I would like to\\r\\ndo it, but you know that I am married and I am bound to my wife.\\r\\nMy wife and children cannot manage the farm while I am gone, and\\r\\nit would cost at least 400 gulden for me to leave the farm and I\\r\\ncannot do that.

In a stream of\\r\\nletters, which poured back into the Netherlands from every corner of North\\r\\nAmerica, they described their successes and disappointments in farming,\\r\\nfactory work, and in a variety of professions.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n</div2>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"25\\\">\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D011\\\">\\r\\n<div2 name=\\\"Chapter 2 Michigan: A Model for Ethnic Solidarity\\\" type=\\\"chapter\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"editorial\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>D</b>utch-Americans, who constitute a very small percentage of the\\r\\ngeneral American populace, have maintained a remarkable\\r\\ndegree of cohesion and identity. As a result, the regions they\\r\\nfirst occupied one hundred thirty years ago &mdash; western\\r\\nMichigan, the Chicago area, and several portions of Wisconsin and lowa &mdash;\\r\\nare still heavily populated and influenced by their descendants.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAll these settlements, except lowa, combined both agricultural and\\r\\nurban opportunities, offering a large variety of employment within easy\\r\\nreach of the ethnic neighborhoods. Poorer immigrants who hoped to\\r\\nbecome farmers could first find employment in factories or mills, later using\\r\\ntheir savings to purchase farms among their countrymen on the fringes of\\r\\nthe city. Some of these immigrants became garden farmers, finding ready\\r\\nmarkets in the urban areas from which they had moved. Meanwhile,\\r\\ncountry boys who preferred business or mechanical trades drifted to the\\r\\ncities.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy the 1870s Dutch communities in Michigan, Chicago, and\\r\\nWisconsin boasted ethnic churches and schools supported by a constituency\\r\\nof artisans and farmers. Arriving in these neighborhoods between 1870 and\\r\\n1920, new immigrants found their own people, language, and institutions.\\r\\nBy the mid-twentieth century, when urban blight spoiled the attractions of\\r\\ncity life, many urban Dutch-Americans joined their country cousins who\\r\\nhad established agricultural communities on the metropolitan fringes. These\\r\\nnew suburbanites were again able to enjoy familiar social patterns, including\\r\\nthe churches, schools, and general mores they had previously supported in\\r\\ntheir urban neighborhoods.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"26\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis conveniently pleasant arrangement of urban-rural mobility\\r\\noccurred first in western Michigan. Albertus C&dot; Van Raalte, who founded\\r\\nhis colony on the shores of Lake Michigan, had neither planned nor\\r\\nencouraged this arrangement. But economic necessity forced his followers to\\r\\nsend their children off among the Americans as hired hands, housemaids,\\r\\nand factory workers. They scattered in all directions: Allegan, Grand\\r\\nHaven, and Grand Rapids. Among these, Grand Rapids offered the best\\r\\nopportunities for employment. In addition, a pious Zeelander named H&dot;\\r\\nVan Driel had already organized a Dutch-language worship service there in\\r\\n1848. Thus, only one year after Van Raalte's people occupied the wooded\\r\\nshore of Black Lake, Van Driel was reading Dutch sermons to an audience\\r\\nwhich included over one hundred young women who were providing\\r\\ndomestic service among the American families of Grand Rapids. By 1851, it\\r\\nis estimated that a total of four hundred Hollanders were living in Grand\\r\\nRapids.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>Michigan Background</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Netherlanders who settled in western Michigan were, of course,\\r\\nnot the first Europeans to investigate that corner of the North American\\r\\nwilderness. As early as 1620 the French had used this area to trade with\\r\\nIndian tribes. And in 1688 Father Jacques Marquette, a missionary-explorer,\\r\\nfounded a permanent village at Saulte Sainte Marie. Since other French\\r\\nmissionaries organized mission stations all along the coast of Lake\\r\\nMichigan, it's not surprising that in 1847 Van Raalte and his followers met a\\r\\ntribe of Christian Indians on the future site of Holland, Michigan.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMichigan afforded Van Raalte a better opportunity to isolate his\\r\\ncolony than did the neighboring states of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, all of\\r\\nwhich had been settled and organized earlier than the Wolverine State.\\r\\nSince Michigan did not gain independent statehood until 1837, Van Raalte\\r\\nwas able to acquire large tracts of unsettled land for his group.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhy was Michigan so slow to develop? Many people were scared off\\r\\nby the surveyors' reports in 1812. After describing a territory that consisted\\r\\nof swamps, lakes, and poor sandy soil not worth the cost of additional\\r\\ninvestigation, these reports asserted, \\\"Not more than one acre in a\\r\\nhundred... would admit of cultivation.\\\" It was further assumed that such\\r\\na region would be very unhealthy for human occupation.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAlthough these reports had been proven false by the time Van Raalte\\r\\narrived in Detroit seeking a place to found his colony, Van Raalte's followers\\r\\nwould soon be able to attest that there was more than a grain of truth in the\\r\\nearly surveyors' words: some regions, including much of the land\\r\\nsurrounding Holland, Michigan, <i>were</i> swampy areas which could not be\\r\\nutilized for many years.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nVan Raalte's efforts in Holland, Michigan, paralleled similar efforts\\r\\namong his American neighbors. The towns and villages in the colony's\\r\\nimmediate vicinity were all youthful and crude, having origins as trading\\r\\n<page n=\\\"27\\\">\\r\\nposts or Indian settlements. Port Sheldon, the colony's nearest neighbor,\\r\\nhad been developed in 1837 for reasons much like those which Van Raalte\\r\\ncherished in selecting Holland. Like Holland, Port Sheldon had access to\\r\\nLake Michigan through an adjoining inland lake that provided a potential\\r\\nharbor. But Port Sheldon had been organized by speculators who hoped to\\r\\nlure purchasers with the promise of spiraling land values. The founders\\r\\nconstructed a huge hotel on the site and had already sold some of the town\\r\\nlots when the economic crisis of 1837 pulled land values down and forced\\r\\nthe town's developers into bankruptcy. Van Raalte proceeded more wisely.\\r\\nHis colony consisted of settlers, not empty projections of speculative wealth.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nVan Raalte's experiment was, however, rather unique. Americans did\\r\\nnot expect fresh European immigrants to settle in the wilderness. That, they\\r\\ncommonly believed, was the peculiar task of the tough American\\r\\nfrontiersmen. In 1831 Alexis de Tocqueville, the well-known author of\\r\\n<i>Democracy in America,</i> recorded this typical view in the words of a Michigan\\r\\nfrontiersman. Asked why so few recent European immigrants could be found\\r\\nin the Michigan wilderness, the frontiersman replied:\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>None but the Americans are brave enough to submit to such\\r\\nprivation, and are willing to pay such a price for [success]. The\\r\\nEuropean immigrant stops in the large towns of the seaboard, or in\\r\\nsurrounding districts. There he becomes a mechanic, a laborer, or a\\r\\nservant. He leads an easier life than in Europe, and appears content\\r\\nthat his children should follow his example. The American takes\\r\\npossession of the land and tries to create out of it a great social\\r\\nposition.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\nThis frontiersman was clearly ignorant of the many exceptions to his\\r\\nopinion, but in general what he said was true: new immigrants tended to\\r\\noccupy lands which others had tamed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D012\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Dutch suffered great hardships as a consequence of their decision\\r\\nto occupy primitive regions. Although choosing unsettled land permitted\\r\\nthem to acquire property directly from the government at $1.25 per acre,\\r\\nthey were forced to add years of toil to that price before the land was\\r\\ntillable. Tocqueville, describing the sort of wilderness these immigrants\\r\\ntamed, wrote:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>As we proceeded, we gradually lost sight of the traces of\\r\\nman.... Before us was the scene that we had so long been\\r\\nseeking &mdash; the primitive forest.... Full-grown trees, almost all pines\\r\\nor oaks, were so confined to so narrow a space that each of these\\r\\ntrees had run up rapidly in search of air and light. As straight as the\\r\\nmast of a ship, the most rapid grower had overtopped every\\r\\nsurrounding object.... Others followed quickly... and the whole\\r\\ngroup formed a sort of immense canopy. Underneath this damp\\r\\nmotionless vault the scene is different.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"28\\\">\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I06.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Majesty and order are overhead &mdash; near the ground all is chaos\\r\\nand confusion: aged trunks, incapable any longer of supporting their\\r\\nbranches, are shattered in the middle and present nothing but a sharp\\r\\njagged point. Others have been thrown unbroken to the\\r\\nground.... Huge trees, sustained by surrounding branches, hang in\\r\\nmid air, and fall into dust without reaching the ground.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D013\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"editorial\\\">\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>Rural Villages</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Dutch colony in Michigan began amid similarly primeval forests.\\r\\nNo plow could turn the soil until the woodland growth of centuries,\\r\\ntogether with its rubble, was removed and burned. Timber from these huge\\r\\ntrees became the first log houses, barns, and churches of Holland and its\\r\\nneighboring settlements. These Dutch-American villages, among which\\r\\nHolland was the leading example, sprang up over a fifty-year period.\\r\\nImmigrants, following the example of Van Raalte and his group, came singly\\r\\nor in clusters, locating their villages with an eye on two characteristics:\\r\\narable land and sufficient isolation to permit the retention of Dutch culture.\\r\\nOnce established, these villages attracted additional immigrants and\\r\\ncontinued to grow until the land was taken up or had become too\\r\\nexpensive.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFrequently the founders of these villages had been neighbors in the\\r\\nNetherlands, and they named their new towns after their places of origin.\\r\\nThus, Dominie Vander Meulen from Zeeland founded Zeeland, Michigan,\\r\\nand Dominie S&dot; Bolks from Overijssel established Overisel, Michigan. By\\r\\n1900 the Dutch-Americans had come to occupy and frequently dominate\\r\\n<page n=\\\"29\\\">\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I07.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\nlarge portions of several counties in western and central Michigan. The\\r\\nnames of their villages &mdash; Drenthe, Harlem, Zutphen, Groningen, and\\r\\nVriesland &mdash; read like a map of the Netherlands.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe history of Holland, Michigan, has been recorded in several\\r\\nexcellent books. Interestingly, the main contours of that story exhibit\\r\\npatterns similar to those of other successful frontier settlements. In 1846,\\r\\nwith about one hundred companions, Rev&dot; Albertus C&dot; Van Raalte migrated\\r\\nfrom Arnhem in the Dutch province of Gelderland to Detroit, Michigan.\\r\\nBecause the Great Lakes channels froze early in 1846, Van Raalte's party\\r\\nremained in Detroit for the winter. Meanwhile, their leader sought a proper\\r\\nlocation for their settlement. After abandoning his preference for\\r\\nWisconsin, Van Raalte traveled to western Michigan and joined company\\r\\nwith Judge John R&dot; Kellogg from Allegan. Together they viewed lands along\\r\\nthe Grand River and the area surrounding Black Lake. After considerable\\r\\ninvestigation, Van Raalte decided to purchase some four thousand acres on\\r\\nthe fringes of Black Lake, for he was convinced that its access to Lake\\r\\nMichigan would facilitate the development of a busy harbor port. To achieve\\r\\nall this, Van Raalte used funds from his own purse and from associates in the\\r\\nNetherlands, but he also acquired loans from sympathetic supporters in New\\r\\nYork.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe earliest efforts at colony building were attended by back-breaking\\r\\nlabor, hunger, and much grief. Along with the unfamiliar tasks of\\r\\npioneering, the colonists suffered a siege of malaria which invaded nearly\\r\\nevery family. Despite these setbacks, the immigrants were hopeful and\\r\\noccasionally euphoric about the future of the colony. In 1847 Gerrit Bouws\\r\\n<page n=\\\"30\\\">\\r\\nreported, \\\"I wish that all who seek the Lord could be here for they would no\\r\\nlonger be surrounded by ungodliness. Here in the colony a man can earn 50\\r\\ncents per day, but among the Americans he can earn more. I must say that\\r\\nthose who are healthy can earn their keep with God's blessing.\\\" More\\r\\nspecifically he noted, \\\"It is good for carpenters here, and for shoemakers, as\\r\\npeople wear out many shoes here. Roofers and wooden-shoe makers will find\\r\\nless work here. The houses are roofed with wood planks and can be built\\r\\nquickly &mdash; in about three days with four men.

The government in Washington sent twenty experts to</i>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"31\\\">\\r\\n<i>measure the mouth of the Black River, and they reported that if piers\\r\\nwere built at the mouth of the river to stop the sand from blocking the\\r\\nentrance, we could have the best harbor and trade center along the\\r\\nlakeshore. This report, combined with the support and good\\r\\nreputation which Van Raalte enjoys from the U&dot;S&dot; Congress and\\r\\nPresident, leaves no doubt about our receiving a $45,000\\r\\nappropriation to build the piers and promote our Dutch colony.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nConcerning other aspects of economic development, Van Eijk wrote:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Farmers who raised crops as soon as their land was cleared are\\r\\nalready doing a good business, and the cleared land [which cost $1.25\\r\\nper acre] is being resold for from $4 to $6 per acre.

By 1854, Zeeland had already\\r\\nattracted about one thousand residents, and its taxable real estate nearly\\r\\nequaled that of Holland. Most of the Dutch settlements, however, remained\\r\\nessentially rural villages &mdash; churches and schools along with a general store\\r\\nand blacksmith shop &mdash; sustained by the farms that dotted the nearby section\\r\\nroads.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D017\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nRev&dot; A&dot; Zwemer, who accepted a call to be the minister of the\\r\\nVriesland Dutch Reformed Church in 1860, gave a detailed description of\\r\\nthat village in a letter to his friend, Rev&dot; Helenius De Kok:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>We no longer live in Holland (the principal city of the colony),\\r\\nbut in Vriesland, 10 miles (3 hours afoot) to the east of Holland.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>The congregation of Vriesland is located to the east of the\\r\\ncolony. Our church is 10 miles from the church in Holland, and 4\\r\\nmiles from the church in Zeeland. (One mile is about 20 minutes\\r\\nwalking). The members of the church come from 76 families. About\\r\\n90 families here are church-going. The whole village consists of about\\r\\n95 &mdash; 96 families with a total population of about 500 people. Almost\\r\\nwithout exception they all live on farms. There is thus no village as\\r\\nyou imagine a village in the Netherlands.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>The ground here is heavy clay. About half of the population are\\r\\nFrisians, and the remaining half come from Gelderland, South\\r\\nHolland, and Zeeland. The school stands a half mile from us. Our\\r\\nschoolmaster is J&dot; den Herder, from Zeeland, a well-known family in\\r\\nthe district of Goes. He is a pious man, and still young. In this\\r\\ncommunity I am now the shepherd and preacher, whose souls I must\\r\\nlead and teach in my work. It is a task for which my heart has longed\\r\\nfor 20 years when I first began to understand the struggle between\\r\\ntruth and error in the church of our fatherland.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>We occupy a moderately good and large house next to the\\r\\nchurch, with a garden between the two. Behind our house are eight or\\r\\nnine acres of newly attached pasture where we keep a cow which we\\r\\nbought for $67.50 a few weeks ago. The house and land belong to the\\r\\ncongregation. We have room. Our whole yard with the area around\\r\\nthe church is about one acre. But we need room with six children.\\r\\nThree of them go to school and learn English and Holland quickly.</i>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"34\\\">\\r\\n<i>Jacob, our oldest, is rather well advanced in geography, arithmetic,\\r\\nand language. Three were born in New York, and three in Michigan,\\r\\nthe last this spring on February 16. We named her Catharina\\r\\nAdriana &mdash; named thus after her father and mother.

A snake, named loopin\\r\\nhere, does not frighten our children, and it is quite common to see\\r\\nhummingbirds (the smallest and most beautiful of birds) flying around\\r\\nthe flower garden to get sap from the flowers. Wild cats, foxes,\\r\\nraccoons, and other little animals still frequently do damage in the\\r\\nhen houses. When these woods were first settled, the howling of the\\r\\nwolves echoed through the night; now they are no longer heard. There\\r\\nare still one or two bears in the neighborhood and they are still seen\\r\\noccasionally. But they seem to understand that the Hollanders have\\r\\nbought these woodlands and that they no longer roam on their own\\r\\nland; for they are afraid of people; but the young people wish there\\r\\nwere more bears around in order to hunt for them.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D018\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nImmigrants were frequently fascinated by the novelties of their new\\r\\nhomes. Peter J&dot; Bulthuis, who worked in the Mill Point sawmills, wrote:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>We still have wild animals in this area such as bears, wolves,\\r\\nand bobcats, but they are off in the deep woods. In the long winters\\r\\nwhen the snow is deep, they come out onto the farms so that farmers\\r\\ncan hear the wolves howling during the night. I talked to one farmer\\r\\nwho told me that he was out late one evening after a fresh snow and\\r\\nhe could see from the tracks that a bear had crossed his path. He\\r\\nfeared for his life, but luckily the bear wandered off into the woods\\r\\nbefore the farmer turned off on his own path. On another occasion I\\r\\nwas told of three people who met each other on the road just as a bear\\r\\ncame out of the woods. Two of them ran off and left the third to\\r\\nconfront the bear. The man was saved by the faithfulness of his dog,\\r\\nfor as the bear came at him, the dog bit the bear so many times that\\r\\nhe gave up his attack and the man ran away. In that way he escaped.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>The Indians are not afraid of bears, for they live by fishing and\\r\\nhunting. They say that when you see a bear, you should look for a\\r\\nthick tree which you can reach more quickly than the bear, and once\\r\\nin the tree, as the bear follows, you must hit him in the nose with\\r\\nyour axe, and then the bear will quickly run off.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>But you should not be frightened by these tales, because the\\r\\nbear do not often come out and then only during very long winters\\r\\nwith very deep snow, and also only during the late evening when\\r\\npeople are out in the woods. We have no trouble from these matters</i>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"35\\\">\\r\\n<i>in the village. And if you like to hunt, we have wild animals here such\\r\\nas deer, rabbit, partridge, ducks, geese, and doves.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>I have also not yet written about the Indians. They are a people\\r\\nwith a somewhat brown skin. They are always in the woods. They\\r\\nlive by seeking a pile of sticks, which they bind together at the top and\\r\\nthen spread out in a regular pattern at the bottom. Then they place a\\r\\nfire in the center of their house and lay their children around the fire.\\r\\nIn the evening they build a large fire and lie around the fire. The\\r\\nwomen cover themselves with a blanket, and the women wear a\\r\\nblanket during the daytime also.

After weeks of\\r\\ntravel and uncertainty, newly arriving immigrants entered comfortable\\r\\nvillages like Vriesland with tears of joy. That they could feel so much at\\r\\nhome so far from their homeland often astounded them, particularly after\\r\\nexperiencing the bewildering maze of novelty forced upon them by travel. In\\r\\n1866 J&dot; J&dot; Koke, describing his arrival in Vriesland, Michigan, wrote, \\\"We\\r\\ncame here at about 6 P&dot;M&dot; on Tuesday, and I cannot describe the joy which\\r\\nwe all felt. The tears flowed just as they did when we said goodbye in\\r\\nGermany.\\\" From Mill Point in 1854 Marcus Nienhuis said, \\\"In this strange\\r\\nland we find ourselves among so many countrymen and friends that it is\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I09.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\n<page n=\\\"36\\\">\\r\\nalmost impossible to believe that we are in a strange land.\\\" Nienhuis\\r\\ncontinued:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>I took a trip to the colony and met a friend of yours.

In\\r\\nthe nineteenth century it was also an unsettled, uncrowded territory. It\\r\\nmust have sounded like the promised land to the Dutch immigrants who\\r\\nhad come from the cramped blocks of cities in the Netherlands. These\\r\\nimmigrants, especially those who arrived early in the state's development,\\r\\nwere able to select homesteads from a liberal supply of available land.\\r\\nUltimately they occupied over two thousand square miles in their adopted\\r\\nstate, an area equal to almost one-sixth of their homeland. Today\\r\\nNetherlanders can be found in significant numbers in at least forty <lacuna>\\r\\nand cities scattered throughout western and central Michigan.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe steady acquisition of agricultural land in Michigan satisfied the\\r\\ndesires of many Dutch-Americans for whom farm ownership stood more\\r\\nhighly than all other material goals. Some immigrants, who had not been\\r\\nfarmers in the Netherlands, proudly reported their agricultural successes to\\r\\nfriends and family members back home.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor example, in 1854 Marcus Nienhuis wrote:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>On the 27th of January, 16 members of our family arrived here\\r\\nin good health, and that meeting gave my morale a great boost. I have\\r\\nworked in the sawmill here since April 15 and I earn $26 per month,\\r\\nwhich equals 65 guilders in Dutch currency. Of this I spend $8, or\\r\\n20 guilders for room and board and this, I think, is good wages. It is,\\r\\nof course, true that I must work hard for this, but it is easy to\\r\\nunderstand that no one will pay such wages for nothing. But it is still\\r\\ntrue that people are not treated like dogs here, and I don't have to\\r\\nwork as hard here as when I sailed as ship hand in Holland.</i>...\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Brother Martinus will also be coming here to Mill Point in a\\r\\nfew days and will also work in the mill for $1 per day; along with that\\r\\nhe gets free housing and heating fuel. The rest of the family works on\\r\\nthe docks in Grand Haven and they also earn good wages. Some days\\r\\nthey earn from $2.50 to $4 per day. Martin Reenders has on one\\r\\noccasion earned $5 in a half day. But then they do not work every\\r\\nday; otherwise they would be rich in a hurry.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>I tell you without falsehood that it is much better for a worker\\r\\nhere than by you.

It is important to\\r\\nsee some land and what kind people are buying. Not all the land is\\r\\ngood. In addition, some land is too far away from water and train\\r\\ntransportation with the result that you can't get your crops to market.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>During my last search I have found something which looks good\\r\\nto me. But for the moment I can't buy it from the government\\r\\nbecause they plan to run a railroad through that area and the precise\\r\\nroute is not yet determined. As soon as the route is established and\\r\\nlaid out, we intend to buy land there. The land is located in North\\r\\nHolland, part of Van Raalte's colony where almost none but\\r\\nHollanders live. I have already purchased 80 acres of woodland there\\r\\nfor $120 from a party who bought it from the government. There are\\r\\nstill two 80-acre parcels next to mine which the government owns,\\r\\nand we would like to buy that too as soon as it is available. These 80-acre\\r\\npieces can be purchased for $100 each. Then we will have it all\\r\\ntogether &mdash; Tamme Wybes Dykema, a brother-in-law of brother\\r\\nMartinus, and I. Eighty acres is a little more than 30 bunders in the\\r\\nNetherlands.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIf Nienhuis had saved eighteen dollars per month he would have\\r\\naccumulated the price of an eighty-acre parcel in just six months. In any\\r\\n<page n=\\\"39\\\">\\r\\ncase he moved to his North Holland farm by February, 1855. During his first\\r\\nfew years there he probably made good use of the lumbering skills he had\\r\\nlearned in Mill Point. The sawmills usually closed down during winter\\r\\nmonths, and part of the work force then moved to the forests to cut trees for\\r\\nthe reopening of the mills after the spring thaw. It was common practice to\\r\\ncut the trees during the winter when they could be hauled over the slippery\\r\\nsnow to the river. In the spring, when the river became a rushing torrent\\r\\ndue to thawing snow and ice, the logs were floated downriver to Mill Point,\\r\\nwhere they piled up for use by the sawmills.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNienhuis probably used these winter months to clear a part of his land\\r\\nand returned to work in the sawmills during the summer. There he could\\r\\naccumulate more cash to clear the land he had purchased.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt was quite common for the poorer immigrants to work in nearby\\r\\ncities while clearing a farm in the colony. This pattern is exemplified by\\r\\nGeert Heerspink, who worked in Allegan while buying and clearing a farm\\r\\nin Holland. In 1850 he wrote to his brother, \\\"We have 56 acres of land in\\r\\nthe colony, with a house and two acres cleared. If the Lord will and we live,\\r\\nwe plan to move there in April.\\\" Then commenting on the colony itself,\\r\\nHeerspink wrote, \\\"Netherlanders are blessed far above others in this\\r\\ncountry &mdash; in the Holland colony there are seven churches and six ministers.\\r\\nThe children are educated in both the Dutch and English language, with\\r\\nspecial attention to the teaching of salvation.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D021\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nImmigrants with more cash than Heerspink could carve farms from\\r\\nthe wilderness with less difficulty, since they could hire their poorer\\r\\nneighbors to help clear the land. Thus, Hendrich Lanning, who immigrated\\r\\nwith a great deal of money, found the New World a virtual paradise.

And in 1860, thirteen years after he had arrived in America, he\\r\\nwrote that all his sons and daughters had reaped rich benefits from his\\r\\ndecision to leave the Netherlands:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>My oldest daughter is married to Sietse Holt.

Thus it is easy\\r\\nto understand Lanning's contentment. Summarizing his satisfaction,\\r\\nLanning wrote, \\\"It is a fat land here.

In 1889\\r\\nAvink was able to increase the size of his farm, but again he faced the back-breaking\\r\\ntask of cutting trees and grubbing stumps. Finally, in 1901, he\\r\\nreported that farming had become much easier since the stumps and roots\\r\\nhad been removed. By then he had also joined a marketing cooperative and\\r\\nwas earning $200 annually for his dairy products. He sold his potato crop in\\r\\nGrand Rapids and noted that pickles and sugar beets could be sold in\\r\\nHolland, where factories to process these crops had been established.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAvink's life, however, was no broad path from pauper to large\\r\\nlandholder. That he did not acquire a larger tract of land was not because he\\r\\nwas disinterested. In his letters Avink continually reported the prices of\\r\\navailable land and lamented their constant increase. He simply could not\\r\\n<page n=\\\"44\\\">\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I15.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\nafford to provide for his sons. It appears that one of his sons did become a\\r\\nfarmer, but for the most part his children found work in the city. Avink\\r\\nseemed pleased to report their success as factory workers.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen his friend in Bargem asked about the prospects for immigrants\\r\\nin Blendon, Avink advised him to consider South Dakota. Blendon was\\r\\nalready overcrowded in 1889, and the land was too expensive. A livable\\r\\nforty-acre farm was selling for two thousand dollars and at least another five\\r\\nhundred was needed to equip it. \\\"Many people,\\\" he wrote, \\\"were moving to\\r\\nSouth Dakota where there was an abundance of good land and few people.\\\"\\r\\nBut most importantly, the land there \\\"cost almost nothing.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt would be fair to say that Avink was marginally successful. He was\\r\\nable to spend his own days engaged in his chosen work, and at least one of\\r\\nhis sons followed his example. The objectives of his other children are\\r\\nunknown. Perhaps they preferred living in the city. Whatever their\\r\\npreferences, these children were able to find work close to the family\\r\\nhomestead. They selected mates of their own nationality and remained loyal\\r\\nto the churches of the extended ethnic community. Many of the Avink\\r\\ndescendants chose this comfortable pattern: today at least fourteen families\\r\\nbearing that name continue to live in the Grand Rapids metropolitan area.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt should be emphasized that the Avinks were not exceptional in\\r\\nmigrating to urban communities. The Dutch-Americans had never confined\\r\\ntheir residences to Van Raalte's colony and its rural satellites. Poverty and\\r\\nthe early struggles for survival forced the immigrants to scatter, and the\\r\\n<page n=\\\"45\\\">\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I16.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\nyoung people frequently worked in neighboring \\\"American\\\" towns and\\r\\ncities. Others joined Michigan's lumberjacks in their winter camps or hired\\r\\nout to \\\"Yankee\\\" farmers. Before long these immigrant laborers formed urban\\r\\nclusters in Kalamazoo, Grand Haven, Muskegon, and Grand Rapids.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe initial lure in all those cities was economic; and when urban\\r\\nimmigrants prospered, they encouraged both their rural acquaintances and\\r\\ntheir friends in the Netherlands to join them. Furthermore, the opportunity\\r\\nto acquire inexpensive agricultural land in the colony decreased during the\\r\\nseventies and eighties. Consequently, both newly arrived immigrants and\\r\\nthe children of the initial settlers were motivated to seek livelihoods outside\\r\\nof the colony. Klass Ridder described these altered circumstances in letters\\r\\nto his family in Staphorst: \\\"Presently there is no demand for farmhands here\\r\\n[in Drenthe, Michigan].\\\" He declared, \\\"There are too many farmhands\\r\\nhere, and they can hardly find places to work. The farmers have too much\\r\\nmachinery, and the hired hands can no longer earn one dollar per\\r\\nday.... Land is increasingly more expensive, and many Dutch people are\\r\\ngoing West to the Dakotas and Iowa, where much more land is available at\\r\\nlower prices than here in the colony.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D025\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"editorial\\\">\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>The Lure of Urban Life</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStructured by its factories, skilled trades, and businesses, urban life\\r\\nconditioned the immigrant's behavior and perspective. Because a majority of\\r\\nthem found their first employment in factories, the newcomers described the\\r\\nchallenge of urban survival by reporting their daily wage, housing expenses,\\r\\n<page n=\\\"46\\\">\\r\\nand grocery bills, rather than the cost of land and livestock.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAlready before the Civil War, Grand Rapids, Muskegon, and other\\r\\nnearby cities contained clusters of Dutch-Americans. Grand Rapids\\r\\nattracted the largest number of immigrants (about two thousand Dutch\\r\\ninhabitants by 1860), but each of the other cities also housed several\\r\\nhundred Dutch residents. During the period of rapid industrialization that\\r\\nfollowed the Civil War, these ethnic enclaves grew steadily.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe experience of Henry Kroes in Muskegon illustrates the precarious\\r\\neconomic situation which confronted factory workers during the 1890s:\\r\\nFrom Ferwerd, Friesland, where diminished economic activity in 1891\\r\\nprovided Kroes with only intermittent employment, he and his wife, Altje\\r\\nBouma, immigrated to Muskegon, Michigan. Altje's parents had preceded\\r\\ntheir daughter and son-in-law to that region during a more flourishing era,\\r\\nand the Boumas' letters had primed Kores to expect \\\"plenty to eat, plenty of\\r\\nmoney, and plenty of work for everyone.\\\" But Kroes arrived just as the high\\r\\ntide of Muskegon's lumber era had begun to ebb, and many of its sawmills\\r\\nwere idle. Thus, the newly arrived young couple was forced to live with the\\r\\nBouma family while looking for employment.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D026\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf his troubled first years in Muskegon, Henry Kroes reported:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Soon after our arrival in America, we joined the First\\r\\nChristian Reformed Church on Terrace Street. Rev&dot; Fles recognized\\r\\nus and asked us how we were and how we liked the new country. We\\r\\ntold him quite well, but that we couldn't find any work. In a very\\r\\nquiet, undisturbed tone, he assured us that everything would be all\\r\\nright if we only had a little patience. But, of course, this good advice\\r\\ndidn't help us much. After about three more weeks of walking from\\r\\nplace to place and asking as best we could for work, we were\\r\\nfortunate in securing a job at the Rolling Mill in Lakeside. A new\\r\\nbuilding was to be erected, and we had to shovel the loose sand away\\r\\nso the foundation of the building could be put on hard sand.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>During the first year we spent in America, Muskegon Heights\\r\\ncame into being, and as I passed a small planing mill located there at\\r\\nthat time, a man came out of the mill and asked me if I wanted to\\r\\nwork. As I was out looking for work, this appealed to me, and I was\\r\\nnever particular as to what kind of work I was expected to do. I\\r\\nworked at whatever I was told to do, as long as I was paid for doing\\r\\nit, because we were really in need of some money. Like all my other\\r\\njobs, this one turned out to be a hard one. This mill was moving to\\r\\ntheir new location in Muskegon Heights, and it was my job to load\\r\\nthe wagons with heavy sacks of cement, logs, machinery, and so on. I\\r\\nworked for four days, ten hours per day, and when everything was\\r\\nmoved and the work was all done, I received four dollars. This was\\r\\nten cents an hour for hard work, and this was the cheapest I ever\\r\\nworked in America.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"47\\\">\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I17.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"48\\\">\\r\\n<i>After this job, I started walking the streets once more hoping\\r\\nfor something else to turn up. Thayer Lumber Company had two saw\\r\\nmills at the foot of Fourth Street and a large lumber company. While\\r\\npassing the lumberyard I stopped to ask for work, and was hired to\\r\\nwork piling lumber. This was the best job I had had up until then, but\\r\\nafter a few days there, a man came up from the mill who needed a\\r\\nman to help there. I, being the newest man on the job, was sent with\\r\\nhim to the mill. I could not understand anything that was said to me,\\r\\nbut, by sign language, I was given to understand to follow him.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>He took me to a place which I afterward learned was the slab\\r\\nhole. The bark and the sides of the log were cut into slabs for burning\\r\\nwood and dumped into this hole, wagonloads at a time, and I was\\r\\nexpected to pile it up or throw it out of the way so the next wagonload\\r\\ncould dump. Also I had to watch out continually for the slabs that\\r\\nwere coming down the chute, so as not to get hit on the head or\\r\\nshoulders. But even by watching, it was impossible to avoid being hit.\\r\\nLumber was cheap in those days, and much of it was burned or\\r\\nwasted. Common sheeting lumber sold for $7 per 1000 feet.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>The first day in the slab hole, I nearly worked myself to death\\r\\ntrying to keep up, and I was so tired at night that I could hardly walk\\r\\nhome. I was telling another employee whom I was walking with about\\r\\nmy experience that day, and he told me not to work so hard. He said\\r\\nto let the hole get full so that they cannot chute any more slabs into it\\r\\nand they'll give me some help. This sounded like good advice. He also\\r\\ntold me that if the boss came and told me to hurry up, I should say,\\r\\n\\\"I'm doing the best I can.\\\" I said this sentence over and over to be\\r\\nsure I'd remember it. The next morning I went to work in the slab\\r\\nhole but worked much slower, and it wasn't long before the chute was\\r\\nblocked. Soon the boss came swearing and cursing, but I merely said\\r\\nwhat I had learned the previous evening. \\\"I do the best I can,\\\" and it\\r\\nwasn't very long before another man came to help me; and this was\\r\\nmuch better.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>During this summer our first baby was born. It was a girl and\\r\\nwe named her Tena. She was born August 1st&dot; My work still was\\r\\nvery uncertain, a few days here and few days there, but the Lord took\\r\\ncare of us, and we always had enough to eat. And, of course, it\\r\\ndidn't take much to feed our small family.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>During our first winter here and the following summer, working\\r\\nconditions did not improve. We still owed the $64 which my wife's\\r\\nfolks had borrowed for us, and this had to be paid. Early in the fall of\\r\\nour second year here, Sypke Steensma, Sjoord Fennema, and Jan\\r\\nBroersma all moved to Grand Rapids, having heard that work was\\r\\nmore plentiful there, but we decided to stay in Muskegon.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>On a certain Sunday evening in the late fall of 1892, Albert\\r\\nBosch came to our house and asked me if I would go to Grand</i>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"49\\\">\\r\\n<i>Haven with him in the morning. He had to go on to North Holland,\\r\\nbut told me if I went with him I could visit with Rev&dot; K&dot; Kuiper who\\r\\nhad been our pastor for seven years in Ferwerd. He had recently\\r\\nmoved to Grand Haven, having been called by the First Christian\\r\\nReformed Church there. Also I had catechism, and had been under\\r\\nhis influence and teaching and had learned to know and like him. In\\r\\nfact, my brother and I always addressed him as Father Kuiper, and I\\r\\nhad a great longing to see him again. So, I decided to make the trip to\\r\\nGrand Haven. However, not having any money to spend for train\\r\\nfare, we had to walk. Upon arriving in Grand Haven at the\\r\\nminister's home, we were heartily welcomed, and I soon felt that he\\r\\nwould like to have us stay in Grand Haven. The following day the\\r\\nminister and I started out looking for work. We called at the corn\\r\\nplanter factory and one or two other places, but without much\\r\\nsuccess. However, the Reverend persuaded me to stay over for the\\r\\nnight, saying we would try again in the morning. That night the\\r\\ndeacons of the church came to the minister's house to count the\\r\\ncollection taken in church the previous Sunday.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Among the deacons was a certain Jacob Dykstra, also a native\\r\\nof Friesland, and he also offered to assist in finding a job for me the\\r\\nnext morning. I accepted this kind offer. So the next morning,\\r\\nDykstra and I started out to look for work. He took me to the\\r\\ntannery and asked a Mr&dot; Nyland, who was then the owner, for work\\r\\nfor me. Mr&dot; Nyland had nothing just then, but he expected to have a</i>\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I18.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\n<page n=\\\"50\\\">\\r\\n<i>job in a month or two and promised to tell Dykstra, who, in turn,\\r\\nwould notify me. In January, 1893, I received a letter from Dykstra\\r\\ntelling me I could come to work in Grand Haven. I decided to go to\\r\\nGrand Haven alone, leaving mother and the baby in Muskegon until\\r\\nI could find a place for all of us to live.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>After a couple of weeks, I decided to look for a place to live\\r\\nwhere my wife and baby could stay with me. I finally found an old\\r\\nabandoned house on Pennoyer Ave. It was hardly liveable, having no\\r\\ndoors and broken windows. But the rent was cheap, so we moved in.\\r\\nI found a man in Grand Haven who had a team of horses and a\\r\\nsleigh. He offered to move our furniture from Muskegon. I was to\\r\\nhelp him, so we started in the morning and arrived in Muskegon\\r\\naround noon. We loaded what little furniture we had accumulated\\r\\nduring our stay in Muskegon and started back for Grand Haven.\\r\\nThis was in the month of February, and it was cold and dark when\\r\\nwe finally got back to Grand Haven. Mother and the baby arrived the\\r\\nnext day by train. We didn't live in this house long before we were\\r\\noffered a much better house, whose owner, an old man, lived\\r\\nupstairs. This was old man Joldersma. Here, too, our living quarters\\r\\nwere very unpleasant.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>While living here, we had a peculiar experience, and we could\\r\\nsee the hand of God leading us along. While working one day, I cut\\r\\nmy hand, and it developed into a severe case of blood poisoning. We\\r\\nhad a grocer who called regularly for the grocery order, but when he\\r\\nnoticed that I was not working, he was afraid we wouldn't be able to\\r\\npay for the groceries we ordered and refused to come. Being perfect\\r\\nstrangers with no money, we didn't know what to do; but God, who\\r\\nsees all things, knew our circumstances, and he laid upon our friend\\r\\nDykstra's heart to undertake for us once more without any effort on\\r\\nour part. He went around and found another grocer who agreed to\\r\\nfurnish us with our daily needs. The grocer's name was Teese, and\\r\\nsoon after this I returned to work.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>The longer we were in Grand Haven, the more acquaintances\\r\\nwe acquired, and among these was an old man, Pete Van Druinen,\\r\\nwho told us he had a house for rent on Pennoyer Ave&dot;, close to where\\r\\nwe had formerly lived. We moved in here, and this was by far the best\\r\\nhouse we had lived in since coming to Grand Haven. This was in the\\r\\nspring of 1893, and the house cost us $3 per month.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>I only worked [until 1896] at the tannery, and then this factory\\r\\nwent bankrupt. Times were hard, but I was fortunate in getting a job\\r\\nat the Brass Foundry as a buffer and polisher. This work was entirely\\r\\nnew to me and so different from what I had been accustomed to, that\\r\\nI found the days extremely long and tiresome. To make matters\\r\\nworse, I contracted rheumatism in my left leg. My job required that I\\r\\nstand up at the buffing wheel, and this I could hardly do without</i>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"51\\\">\\r\\n<i>suffering tremendous pain. Every day I hoped the pain would leave on\\r\\nthe morrow, and again and again I would go to the doctor, hardly\\r\\nbeing able to walk home after one of his treatments. At the Brass\\r\\nFoundry, we had only piece work, and I had to work hard to make\\r\\n$1.25 per day. These were the darkest days during our stay in Grand\\r\\nHaven.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>About this time the tannery was sold to a new owner, and he\\r\\nstarted operating it again. As soon as I heard about this I applied for\\r\\nmy former job and it was given to me again. So now I was once more\\r\\nfishing wet and slimy bark and hides out of the large vats. We wore\\r\\nrubber boots to keep our legs and feet dry, but these boots wore out,\\r\\nand there was never any money left over to buy new boots, so that I\\r\\nalways had wet feet and legs. Soon I was bothered with rheumatism\\r\\nagain, and on the advice of the doctor we decided to quit the tannery\\r\\nand move back to Muskegon. This was in the summer of 1901. A\\r\\nnew problem arose. In disposing of the house, we were eager to get as\\r\\nmuch money as we could out of it, but the house was hard to sell.\\r\\nFinally we found someone who paid us what we had invested, which\\r\\nwas not much, and he also paid the unpaid balance. So we left\\r\\nGrand Haven with our five children. We found a house on Hamburg\\r\\nStreet between Pine and Spring Streets. Here we had to pay five\\r\\ndollars per month rent.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nH&dot; Kroes's migrations between Muskegon and Grand Haven illustrate\\r\\nsome of the characteristics that defined the Dutch-Americans' urban\\r\\nenclave. In each of his migrations, for example, Kroes sought out the local\\r\\npastor, who provided assistance in finding housing and employment.\\r\\nFurther, the contacts which led to employment were generally discovered\\r\\nwithin the ethnic community, and when sickness impoverished his family,\\r\\nKroes acquired food, credit, and financial support from the church and its\\r\\nmembers. That Kroes did not migrate to Grand Rapids for work probably\\r\\nstemmed from his immediate family attachments and his loyalty to the\\r\\nchurch which had come to his aid.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTogether, then, the local congregation and familial ties bound Kroes\\r\\nto a region in which his economic prospects were unsure. Several of his\\r\\nacquaintances (Steensma, Fennema, and Broersma) did migrate to Grand\\r\\nRapids, a city that provided a wider range of economic opportunity than\\r\\nMuskegon and Grand Haven. The \\\"Furniture City\\\" also contained west\\r\\nMichigan's largest concentration of Dutch-Americans, together with a full\\r\\nspectrum of their social conventions and institutions such as churches,\\r\\nschools, and small businesses. One publicist claimed that by the 1920s only\\r\\nfifteen cities in the Netherlands contained larger numbers of Dutchspeaking\\r\\npeople than Grand Rapids.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D027\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"editorial\\\">\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>Grand Rapids: The Urban Capital of Dutch-America</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAlready during the 1870s Grand Rapids provided many occupational\\r\\n<page n=\\\"52\\\">\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I19.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\nalternatives for Dutch immigrants in western Michigan, and it soon\\r\\nsurpassed Van Raalte's colony as the urban center for Holland-Americans. A\\r\\nReformed Church had been organized in Grand Rapids even before Van\\r\\nRaalte established his colony. But since this congregation used the English\\r\\nlanguage, the new immigrants found little comfort in its ministry. Still, the\\r\\nbond of common ecclesiastical origins fostered immediate cooperation\\r\\nbetween the immigrants and their American countrymen. In 1849 the\\r\\nEnglish-speaking church offered its sanctuary to the new arrivals without\\r\\ncharge. One year later the immigrants organized their own church, and by\\r\\n1875 it had spawned two additional congregations. Meanwhile another\\r\\nimmigrant denomination had also been organized in Grand Rapids.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis astounding rate of church organization was related directly to\\r\\nemployment opportunities in Grand Rapids. Jacob Dunnink wrote, \\\"My\\r\\ndaughter Geertje has married a Zeelander and they have built a new house\\r\\nin Grand Rapids. He earns $1 per day. If they remain healthy, they will\\r\\nmake a good living. There is a large Dutch congregation with a minister\\r\\nfrom Zeeland in Grand Rapids.\\\" Dunnink's daughter had worked in Grand\\r\\nRapids as a domestic servant and probably met her husband there. It was\\r\\ncommon practice for unmarried Dutch girls from the colony to work among\\r\\n<page n=\\\"53\\\">\\r\\nthe wealthier people in Grand Rapids. Already in 1848 there were over 100\\r\\nDutch girls providing domestic service in Grand Rapids. Thus information\\r\\nabout job opportunities in Grand Rapids was readily available in the colony\\r\\nand, through correspondence, news about the situation in Grand Rapids\\r\\nreached the Netherlands regularly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMost importantly, Grand Rapids offered the Dutch immigrants those\\r\\namenities which have always been necessary to attract them in large\\r\\nnumbers: a church with theological patterns drawn from the Netherlands,\\r\\nan opportunity to work and provide for their future, and a sufficiently large\\r\\nethnic community to produce husbands and wives for their children.

Even more surprising, a friend\\r\\nnamed Anton Hannink had rented a house for them with furniture and an\\r\\ninitial supply of foodstuffs. The Wonninks found work at a paper mill in the\\r\\nnearby village of Rockford, but as soon as possible they relocated in Grand\\r\\nRapids, which they liked better, \\\"because,\\\" he wrote, \\\"we can now go to the\\r\\nchurch and Sunday School regularly which we could not do when Herman\\r\\nand I worked at the paper mill because it was too far from the church.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen assessing his first half-year's experience, Wonnink wrote:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>America is a good land for a laborer who wants to improve his\\r\\nlot by honorable labor with his hands.

Wonnink arrived in Grand\\r\\nRapids during a period of economic expansion which enhanced the\\r\\nprobabilities of his success. Others, writing during periods of economic\\r\\ncrisis, were less enthusiastic. In 1876, Jacobus Pietersen wrote:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Times are very hard here in the United States....

Thus he remained rather\\r\\nlighthearted about his circumstances. After he was laid off from his factory\\r\\njob, he acquired work as a farmhand twenty-five miles outside of Grand\\r\\nRapids. He had not yet seen the farmer, and explained, \\\"All this is by word\\r\\nof mouth, and if I don't like what I see, I'll just leave. This job is with the\\r\\nYankees &mdash; &lsquo;Yankees&rsquo; is what we call the Americans here.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn 1884, during another period of economic crisis, S&dot; Timmerman\\r\\nwrote, \\\"At the moment it is not very pleasant here.

But the city attracted\\r\\nlaboring folk rather than the educated. As A&dot; C&dot; Van Raalte explained to\\r\\nAbraham Kuyper in 1872, there was some need for schoolteachers among\\r\\nthe Dutch, but the great mass of immigrants would do best by seeking work\\r\\nin factories or as skilled workmen. An immigrant named J&dot; Verweg had\\r\\n<page n=\\\"55\\\">\\r\\ncome to Holland, Michigan, bearing a letter of recommendation from\\r\\nAbraham Kuyper. Van Raalte wrote Kuyper, \\\"I'm sorry if I have\\r\\ndisappointed you, but your recommendations do little good here, and my\\r\\nbroad recommendations are equally useless. Strenuous exertion is the only\\r\\nthing that counts here.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nVerweg, it seems, had hoped to find work in an office and expected\\r\\nwell-paid responsibilities, but he was disappointed. Van Raalte painted\\r\\nanother picture of the opportunities in Grand Rapids, \\\"where,\\\" he wrote,\\r\\n\\\"many Hollanders live in a fast-growing factory town. They use hand\\r\\nlaborers in the factory for making furniture, doors, and windows.... The\\r\\nskilled jobs pay the best and provide good prospects for those who will\\r\\nlearn.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nVan Raalte's message differed little from that of ordinary laborers who\\r\\nsent letters to their friends and relatives. Their reports provided sufficient\\r\\nincentive to attract the common folk. Agnes Nestor described the coming\\r\\nof these new immigrants in her memoirs from the 1880s. \\\"We liked living\\r\\nnear the railroad depot,\\\" she wrote. \\\"We could see the trains arriving, and\\r\\nwhen there was a trainload of Dutch immigrants coming in, we would hurry\\r\\ndown to the depot. The newcomers still wore their native costumes and\\r\\ntheir clumping wooden shoes. They came to work in the Grand Rapids\\r\\nfurniture factories, and they brought along their families.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNestor correctly recognized that the Dutch tended to immigrate in\\r\\nfamily groups. But large numbers of unmarried immigrants also settled in\\r\\nwest Michigan. While family members could encourage each other in the\\r\\nface of loneliness and insecurity, single folk were more susceptible to social\\r\\nisolation and homesickness. Though their economic burdens were relatively\\r\\nlight, they frequently missed the supporting concern of their parents and\\r\\nsiblings. Some, like Jan Hofman, boarded with friends or in the homes of\\r\\nimmigrant families where they could recapture some aspects of family life.\\r\\nNonetheless, intimate family connections could only be maintained with\\r\\ncorrespondence.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D031\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPleading with his brother, \\\"I hope you will write back directly.

The dilemma that motivated his pleas concerned the\\r\\nmost serious decisions of his life.

Chicago also\\r\\nbecame the railroad transportation center of the Midwest, the place where\\r\\nGeorge Pullman organized a company to fabricate railroad cars. By 1870,\\r\\nthis Illinois city boasted a population of 300,000.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>Two Settlements: The Low Prairie and the High Prairie</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Dutch entered this area in 1846, when six families purchased a\\r\\nregion of land called the Low Prairie. Later, remembering their place of\\r\\nbirth, they dubbed the village South Holland.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn 1849 another cluster of Dutch families moved onto the open land\\r\\nsix miles closer to Chicago and named their settlement the High Prairie.\\r\\nAfter a time this area was called Roseland.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThese agricultural communities found ready markets in Chicago and\\r\\ntended to concentrate on garden farming. In a short time Dutch settlers\\r\\nbranched out to the southeast, occupying additional farmland in Oak Glen\\r\\nand Munster. By 1853 Dutch immigrants had claimed several thousand acres\\r\\nand had access to Ridge Road, a main artery to the Chicago markets. Over\\r\\nthe next forty years these original settlements spawned new Dutch-American\\r\\ncommunities in Highland, De Motte, and Wichert, all with\\r\\naccess to Chicago's markets.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"60\\\">\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I21.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAmong these early agricultural settlements, Roseland was the first to\\r\\nbecome diversified. It all started when George Pullman constructed his\\r\\nrailroad car factory within easy reach of the Dutch settlement. The factory\\r\\nattracted a large work force, and property values rose rapidly. Land\\r\\npurchased at $5 per acre in 1849 sold for $2,000 per acre in 1880. At such\\r\\nprices farmers sold to subdividers and moved to less expensive lands\\r\\navailable among their countrymen in South Holland, Munster, and\\r\\nelsewhere.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMany of the immigrants who joined the Roseland community after\\r\\n1880 became urbanites, often finding employment in the factories of George\\r\\nPullman. But they remained Dutch: the Roseland-South Holland nexus\\r\\ncreated an urban-rural region in which Dutch-American institutions could\\r\\nflourish and expand. Farmers' sons, seeking release from the land, could find\\r\\nemployment and the ministrations of a Dutch church in Roseland as well as\\r\\nin the country.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>The Groninger's Hoek</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThere was also a growing concentration of Dutch-Americans close to\\r\\nChicago's center. That neighborhood, often called the \\\"Groninger's Hoek,\\\"\\r\\ndates from 1848. The earliest settlers there, primarily from Groningen,\\r\\nfound profitable employment in Chicago. Peter Ritsma from Vierhuizen\\r\\nwrote that he and his brother were \\\"earning $18 per month.

Rev&dot; C&dot; Vander Meulen, the founder of the\\r\\nZeeland, Michigan, colony, served this Chicago church from 1858 to 1860;\\r\\nbut the church did not thrive until Rev&dot; de Beij accepted their call in 1868.\\r\\nWithout his vigorous leadership this Dutch community in Chicago probably\\r\\nwould have become stagnant or ethnically mingled.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D034\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLike his parishioners, de Beij had immigrated from Groningen, and he\\r\\nsoon became an ardent advocate of emigration to Chicago. By 1869 he was\\r\\nalready providing instructions to prospective emigrants. In the <i>Provincial\\r\\nGroninger Courant</i> he suggested that immigrants could avoid complications\\r\\nafter arriving in New York by traveling on the Pennsylvania Central\\r\\nRailroad. Earlier travelers had complained that their trip to Chicago had\\r\\ntaken a whole week because of delays and false information. To avoid this,\\r\\nde Beij offered precise instructions:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>People should follow these instructions &mdash; buy your tickets at the\\r\\nNew York office located at No&dot; 8 Battery Place, and Pier No&dot; 1,\\r\\nNorth River, which is just a few steps away from Castle Garden.\\r\\nThey will take particular care with your luggage. Immigrants will get\\r\\ntickets for their goods in Castle Garden and they will exchange these\\r\\ntickets for their luggage when they arrive at their destination. Every\\r\\npassenger is allowed 80 pounds (Dutch) of luggage without extra\\r\\ncost, and for those who buy tickets from the above-named office, their\\r\\nluggage will be picked up from Castle Garden and other places and be\\r\\ncarried to the railroad station without cost.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>The passenger cars are well-ventilated, comfortable, and\\r\\nfurnished with water and lights. The passengers, or immigrants, will\\r\\nreach Chicago from New York in just 40 hours and their luggage will\\r\\nbe carried on the same train. Other destinations will be reached at the\\r\\nsame rate of speed, depending on the distance from New York.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>The agent at the Pennsylvania Central Station is John\\r\\nMcDonald, No&dot; 8 Battery Place and Pier No&dot; 1, North River, New\\r\\nYork. It is my concern and interest in the welfare of my [countrymen]\\r\\nwhich has motivated me to search out this information, and people\\r\\ncan rest assured that the above information is accurate and they can\\r\\ndisregard whatever else they have heard.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTwo years later de Beij wrote a detailed eye-witness account of the\\r\\nChicago Fire. He reported that among those people attending the three\\r\\nChicago Dutch churches, only two families had suffered losses. Of the\\r\\nNetherlanders attending English churches de Beij could make no accurate\\r\\nreport, but he estimated that no more than twenty Dutch families had been\\r\\nburned out by the fire. Despite the huge destruction caused by the fire, de\\r\\nBeij remained confident about Chicago's future. He wrote:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"62\\\">\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I22.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>There will be work and high wages in this city for years to\\r\\ncome &mdash; even better than it has been before.

His father\\r\\nhad attempted various occupations, including the cultivation of an eighty-acre\\r\\nfarm on Chicago's western fringes. But, for most of his life Stob worked\\r\\nas a trash hauler or as the proprietor of his own feed and grain store. During\\r\\na three-year interval the Stobs attempted farming in a Dutch settlement in\\r\\nWinie, Texas, but they could not endure the hardships of alternating\\r\\ndrought and flood. Thereafter they returned to their former Chicago\\r\\nneighborhood, and moved, several years later, to Englewood to be near the\\r\\nChristian high school. In all these migrations the Stobs never deserted the\\r\\nsupporting comforts of the Dutch church and its members.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"63\\\">\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D035\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"editorial\\\">\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>Moving to the Suburbs</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nToday few Dutch-Americans remain in their original urban\\r\\nneighborhoods.

In\\r\\n1950 the town had 3,247 residents and included 85 farms. By 1960 the\\r\\npopulation had risen to 10,412 and the farms were reduced to 47.

The promoters, he\\r\\nsaid, were worse than Judas Iscariot, for that betrayer had at least returned\\r\\nthe blood money. Koopman then exiled himself from all Dutch\\r\\nassociations &mdash; the church, the Dutch consul, and the Dutch language\\r\\nnewspapers which had publicized the Texas venture.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nReporting his experience to a nephew in Borger, Koopman wrote:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Two Dutch ministers sent many of their members to Texas\\r\\nwhere they had 5,000 acres belonging to a Holland organization.\\r\\nThey put out a booklet saying that it was a land flowing with milk\\r\\nand honey. Four Dutch ministers and a leading man in a large\\r\\nbusiness signed the booklet. I went to see Dominie Dykstra and asked\\r\\nhim many questions because he had seen the settlement and I was\\r\\ninterested in going there. So, I took the trip, but when I got to the last</i>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"68\\\">\\r\\n<i>stop on the railroad line, I had to stay overnight in a hotel: the\\r\\nsettlement was still twenty-five miles away, with no railway\\r\\nconnections.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>On the following day I started walking to the\\r\\nsettlement....

Most Dutch\\r\\nimmigrants remained in their ethnic communities, finding comfort from\\r\\ntheir churches and pleasure in the company of their own people. Klaas\\r\\nNiemeijer, who immigrated in 1904, followed this more familiar pattern.\\r\\nThe Niemeijers traveled directly to Chicago, where they found temporary\\r\\nshelter with another Dutch family. Within four days they had rented an\\r\\napartment at seven dollars per month and Niemeijer had begun work as a\\r\\nteamster, hauling trash from Chicago at ten dollars per week.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Niemeijers remained in the \\\"Groninger's Hoek\\\" for six years,\\r\\nsettling into the community. Their children attended the Holland school,\\r\\nfor which Niemeijer paid $1.50 per month. The family attended the Dutch\\r\\nchurch, enjoyed sermons in their native tongue, and drank coffee with\\r\\nfellow parishioners after the services. They traveled to other Dutch\\r\\nneighborhoods in the city to meet acquaintances and friends from the\\r\\nNetherlands, and they read the Dutch-language newspaper, <i>Onze Toekomst,</i>\\r\\nwhich informed them of events in the Netherlands as well as in America.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn 1907 Klaas Niemeijer was able to make a proud announcement. He\\r\\nhad become a farmer, the realization of a long-term objective. Before\\r\\ncoming to America Niemeijer had immigrated to Germany and had\\r\\naccumulated some capital by working in a coal mine. He had used that cash\\r\\nto establish a pig farm in the Netherlands, but disease had killed off his\\r\\nherd. With the balance of his money he bought passage to America. Thus,\\r\\nin 1907, when he finally achieved his goal, Klaas wrote:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>We no longer live in Chicago, but close by &mdash; about three hours\\r\\nfrom the center of the city, or about twenty minutes from the city\\r\\nline.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>We have rented 40 acres here for $130 annually &mdash; that is 20\\r\\nacres of crop land, and 20 acres of pasture. A house comes with the\\r\\nfarm and it costs nothing extra. The streetcar is about five minutes\\r\\nfrom our door, and we take it to go to church, which is about a half\\r\\nhour away from us &mdash; it is a Dutch church. Our children go to the\\r\\nEnglish school now which is about 10 rods (50 steps) off from our\\r\\nhouse. There are 10 or 11 Holland families here and we all rent our\\r\\nfarms.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"70\\\">\\r\\n<i>A German Jew lived here before us, and we bought from him\\r\\ntwo horses, a cow, and a wagon for $80. For $15 we bought hay,\\r\\nthree plows, a harrow, a sowing machine, but they are not worth\\r\\nmuch &mdash; a pitch fork which is also worth little. Also ten chickens, and\\r\\nthen still more odds and ends. All of this we bought from the Jew,\\r\\nwho also lives in this house, and now he must move so we can move\\r\\nin. For all this we paid $550. Now we are farmers.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNiemeijer worked his garden farm for ten years, bringing crops to the\\r\\nChicago market two or three times each week. For fertilizer, he hauled free\\r\\nmanure from the Chicago stockyards. But, as the city grew to the west, his\\r\\nland was sold and Niemeijer turned to wholesaling. He bought celery from\\r\\nDutch farmers in western Michigan and transported it to Chicago for resale.\\r\\nDuring that period he moved back into the Dutch community on Chicago's\\r\\nwest side. Finally, when he was too old to care for himself, Klaas lived with\\r\\nhis daughter in suburban Hinsdale, where she had married a farmer named\\r\\nSchooneveld.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn 1953, when Klaas was 88 years old, he proudly reported, \\\"I believe\\r\\nthat I have 30 grandchildren and 40 great-grandchildren, therefore quite a\\r\\ngroup.\\\" His children had scattered somewhat, but for the most part they\\r\\nlived nearby. One son, two hundred miles off, lived in Muskegon,\\r\\nMichigan, among other Dutch-Americans. Thus, there were no serious\\r\\nbreaches in the ethnic web.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNiemeijer's life followed familiar patterns carved from the\\r\\nopportunities embedded in the character of the Dutch settlements of the\\r\\nChicago area. His personal history was duplicated by many others on both\\r\\nthe south and west sides of the city. These social-economic configurations,\\r\\nobviously similar to those in western Michigan, were also established by\\r\\nDutch-Americans in Wisconsin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n</div2>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"71\\\">\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D042\\\">\\r\\n<div2 name=\\\"Chapter 4 Settlements in Wisconsin\\\" type=\\\"chapter\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>W</b>isconsin, often called \\\"America's Dairyland,\\\" is a famous\\r\\nproducer of dairy products, especially cheese.

In 1851 Gijsbert van\\r\\nSteenwijk reported the presence of nearly eight hundred Dutch-Americans\\r\\nin that area. Van Steenwijk was well-educated and stood aloof from the\\r\\nDutch community that had begun to develop in Milwaukee. He described\\r\\nthem as \\\"poor and in many respects backward, but nonetheless honest and\\r\\nhardworking.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy 1856 Dutch immigrants, occupying the northwest section of the\\r\\ncity, had created a neighborhood marked by solid homes and a church.\\r\\nJacob Quintus, editor of the Sheboygan <i>Nieuwsbode,</i> wrote, \\\"They have seen\\r\\ntheir efforts crowned with excellent results. The miserable shanties in which\\r\\nthey have lived for a half dozen years have made way for excellent buildings,\\r\\nand still the Hollanders are forging ahead.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nObviously, an ethnic community of this sort with connected rural\\r\\nsettlements near the fringes of the city could have provided an ethnic\\r\\ncorridor for geographic mobility. In the Milwaukee area, however, the lure\\r\\nof the city surpassed that of the farm, and by the 1890s the nearby rural\\r\\ncommunities had been absorbed into the city. Ultimately the Dutch ethnic\\r\\ncommunity in Milwaukee disintegrated.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe history of Milwaukee's Dutch community is clearly illustrated in\\r\\nthe experience of P&dot; Lankester, who emigrated from Veere, Zeeland, in\\r\\n1849. Lankester settled in Franklin Prairie, fifteen miles outside of\\r\\nMilwaukee, and from the outset, he demonstrated an ambitious perception\\r\\nof Milwaukee's economic opportunities. Although a baker, he was quick to\\r\\nrecognize other opportunities. In 1850 he noted that the city of Milwaukee\\r\\nhad no starch factory, although the ingredients needed to manufacture the\\r\\nproduct were available at low prices. Because he was not familiar with the\\r\\nmethods for making starch, he asked his brother in Veere to provide\\r\\ndetailed instructions explaining the starch-making procedures used in the\\r\\n<page n=\\\"74\\\">\\r\\nNetherlands. Seventeen years later Lankester sought his brother's assistance\\r\\nin acquiring the plans for a potato-peeling machine. Lankester's housemaid,\\r\\na recent immigrant from Amsterdam, had reported that such a machine was\\r\\nbeing used in her native city. Lankester hoped to acquire a drawing of the\\r\\nmachine and intended to patent the invention in America, where, he\\r\\nwrote, \\\"Hand labor is too expensive to peel potatoes, and in general people\\r\\nare too lazy to peel them by hand, and thus unpeeled potatoes are served on\\r\\nthe tables.\\\" He did not expect to manufacture the machine, but rather to\\r\\nacquire an income from patent rights.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D044\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLankester did not depend on such opportunistic ventures for his\\r\\nlivelihood.

The city of Sheboygan, which had been settled by\\r\\n1834, offered some opportunities for day laborers; but it was little more than\\r\\na village and could not sustain so large a work force as Chicago or Grand\\r\\nRapids. Thus the Dutch-American community in Wisconsin did not extend\\r\\nmuch beyond Sheboygan County. Still, because Sheboygan provided\\r\\nemployment in mills and on the docks, the urban-rural pattern did develop\\r\\nthere. By the 1870s the town also acquired factories. So a number of\\r\\nimmigrants who worked in Milwaukee moved to Sheboygan. Others were\\r\\ndrawn from temporary employment in eastern cities such as Buffalo and\\r\\nRochester, New York.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWithin one decade Sheboygan County immigrants had established\\r\\nfour rural towns, and several families had also settled in the port city. The\\r\\nexperience of Graadus Heinen, who immigrated from Aalten in 1854, was\\r\\nprobably typical. He traveled directly to Sheboygan, where he found lodging\\r\\nwith his brother-in-law. Heinen began working immediately, claiming that\\r\\nhis salary for one day's work equalled that of a whole week's wage in the\\r\\n<page n=\\\"77\\\">\\r\\nNetherlands. Food, and meat particularly, he declared, was so inexpensive\\r\\nthat \\\"we never lived better than this in the Netherlands.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nShortly after immigrating, Heinen rented an eighty-acre farm on a\\r\\nseven-year lease. Twenty acres of the land had been cleared, and he was\\r\\nable to pay his rent by selling lumber from the uncleared land. For extra\\r\\ncash he hired himself out to neighboring farmers. In one instance, Heinen\\r\\nreported, an American farmer paid him a dollar per day plus food and\\r\\nlodging. While there Heinen reported, \\\"I ate as good as the best citizen in\\r\\nAalten.\\\" Further, he enjoyed the service of a Dutch church and the\\r\\ncompany of his brother, Abraham, who lived a half hour's distance away.\\r\\nHeinen proudly announced the purchase of milk cows, oxen, and farm\\r\\nmachinery. He asserted, \\\"We cannot thank the Lord enough for having sent\\r\\nus to North America, because we have a good and blessed life here.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D049\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHowever, by 1859 opportunities for penniless immigrants decreased.\\r\\nC&dot; Snoeyenbosch, who had been a resident of Sheboygan County for twelve\\r\\nyears, offered detailed advice to a prospective immigrant in Winterswijk:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>You ask how things go here for someone who comes with little\\r\\nor no money.

But for those who wished to become large\\r\\nindependent farmers, he had other advice. He suggested that they immigrate\\r\\nto Iowa, Minnesota, or other less-settled areas. Sheboygan County was\\r\\nalready beginning to fill up. In 1852, according to Dominie P&dot; Zonne, it\\r\\nalready had two hundred farmsteads covering about six thousand acres. Jacob\\r\\nQuintus, editor of the <i>Sheboygan Nieuwsbode,</i> reported a large influx of new\\r\\nimmigrants in the mid-50s&dot; Land was still available in the Sheboygan area,\\r\\nbut the prices were rising rapidly. Thus, opportunities for the poorest\\r\\nimmigrants had begun to dwindle.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSnoeyenbosch's advice &mdash; to seek less-expensive land in the west &mdash; was\\r\\nwell-founded. Many immigrants moved from Wisconsin, Michigan, and\\r\\nelsewhere to Minnesota and Iowa. From Iowa they trekked to South Dakota,\\r\\nNebraska, and Kansas. They were not merely content to provide for\\r\\nthemselves, but were also anxious to secure farms for their sons and\\r\\ngrandsons.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"79\\\">\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I31.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe search for fertile but inexpensive land continued until the turn of\\r\\nthe century. The immigrants' sons and grandsons, as well as new arrivals,\\r\\nwrote constantly about the cost and availability of farmland. Many were\\r\\nwilling to reestablish themselves when prospects seemed more attractive\\r\\nelsewhere, but they seldom set up housekeeping beyond the reach of other\\r\\nDutch-Americans and their churches. Roelof Brinks, who had immigrated\\r\\nfrom Emmen in 1853, moved to Orange City, Iowa, after working and\\r\\nfarming in Michigan for twenty-six years. In 1879 Brinks reported that he\\r\\nhad moved to Orange City because the land in Michigan was too expensive\\r\\nfor his children. And, he added, \\\"Iowa is all prairie, has no trees and is very\\r\\npleasant. The soil is very fertile. We have 240 acres and I have already sold\\r\\nmy land in Michigan.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nJohn Brinks, Roelof's brother, had moved to Iowa eight years earlier.\\r\\nRoelof wrote, \\\"John has 120 acres which our children will inherit, because\\r\\nhe is unmarried and has no children.\\\" Then three years later Roelof offered\\r\\nadditional advice to his family in Drenthe, pointing them to a new\\r\\nsettlement 140 miles westward in South Dakota where \\\"you can get 160\\r\\nacres for almost nothing under the Homestead Laws. It is not yet populated,\\r\\nbut it looks like a good future for people who are willing to work.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThus the word was out. Land in the Great Plains states could provide\\r\\nhomes for the poorest immigrants. The drama could be reenacted.\\r\\nImmigrants who had temporarily settled in Michigan, Illinois, and\\r\\nWisconsin, together with a host of new arrivals, moved through Pella to\\r\\nwestern Iowa, South Dakota, and beyond.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n</div2>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"81\\\">\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D050\\\">\\r\\n<div2 name=\\\"Chapter 5 Farming in the West\\\" type=\\\"chapter\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"editorial\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>A</b>s the midwestern colonies became crowded, many immigrants\\r\\nlooked further west. Dutch immigrants joined their new\\r\\ncountrymen in a headlong rush for land whenever new regions\\r\\nbecame available. And as more immigrants flooded into the\\r\\ncountry, looking for fertile soil, the United States government, both by war\\r\\nand treaty, pushed the native Americans into undesirable areas. Between\\r\\n1850 and 1900 literally hundreds of immigrant villages dotted the western\\r\\nlandscape.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe treeless prairies and plains offered opportunities quite different\\r\\nfrom those in the woodlands of Michigan and Wisconsin. On the prairie\\r\\nimmigrants were able to cultivate their land immediately. Also, unlike the\\r\\nconstruction of log homes in the north, building sod houses required few\\r\\nspecial skills.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut these prairie settlers also faced unique difficulties. Fuel was scarce;\\r\\nmany immigrants resorted to burning woven bundles of prairie grass or\\r\\nimported coal. Also, the weather was unpredictable: wind storms, carrying\\r\\nsnow or dust, brought extensive hardship and damage. And prairie fires,\\r\\nfanned by strong winds, caused frequent anxiety and occasional disaster.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDespite these difficulties, Netherlanders emigrated to the West\\r\\nregularly between 1847 and 1920. Other Dutch-Americans, lured from the\\r\\ncities and smaller farms of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Illinois, soon joined\\r\\nthem.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThese settlers established communities in which almost every activity\\r\\nsupported the needs of the farmer. Agriculture fosters relatively sparse\\r\\npatterns of population, especially when each farmer cultivates parcels\\r\\n<page n=\\\"82\\\">\\r\\naveraging 160 acres or more. Thus, Dutch villages like Pella and Orange\\r\\nCity in Iowa never became thickly populated commercial centers. Trade\\r\\nroutes passed through these towns on the way to Chicago and St&dot; Louis, but\\r\\nthe farmer's convenience restricted the growth of the country village. To\\r\\nsucceed, the banks, mills, and churches of these places had to be located\\r\\nwithin convenient reach. Farmers located up to twelve miles from town\\r\\ncould make a round trip to the mill or blacksmith in one day with a horse\\r\\nand wagon. When settlers located beyond the twelve-mile range, towns\\r\\nwith churches and other institutions sprang up within the newly occupied\\r\\nregions. These forces scattered the Dutch-American community across the\\r\\nlandscape in small village-oriented concentrations.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>Iowa: The Richest Soil</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn 1847 Pella became the first Dutch colony across the Mississippi\\r\\nRiver. Scholte and his followers selected that site for several reasons. First,\\r\\nand most important, they were convinced of its agricultural potential. But\\r\\nthey were also influenced by its location: the town was built on a road\\r\\nleading to markets in Keukuk. And it was near the Des Moines River,\\r\\nthought to be a potential trade route to St&dot; Louis and the Mississippi River.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAlthough the land lived up to their expectations, its location never\\r\\npaid off for these Netherlanders. They soon discovered that the distance\\r\\nbetween Pella and the markets of Keukuk &mdash; approximately 120 miles &mdash; was\\r\\ntoo far to make business there a realistic option. Also, attempts to improve\\r\\nand use the Des Moines River never succeeded. Pella remained an isolated\\r\\ncolony until railroads reached the area in 1866.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFrom its inception, Pella, with its treeless surroundings, provided an\\r\\nalternative to Van Raalte's colony amid the Michigan forests. Settlers in\\r\\neach location sought information with which to compare the relative\\r\\nsuccess of the two settlements. Thus, in 1849 H&dot; Van Eijk from Holland,\\r\\nMichigan, urged his friend H&dot; Van Asselt to \\\"write about Rev&dot; H&dot; P&dot; Scholte\\r\\nand his colony.\\\" For Van Eijk said, \\\"They do not speak well of it here.

He and\\r\\nVan Eijk probably met during their travels from Europe and apparently were\\r\\nacquainted with another young man, G&dot; H&dot; Meyer, who <i>did</i> settle in Pella.\\r\\nBoth Van Asselt and Van Eijk had heard negative reports about Pella, and\\r\\nMeyer sought to correct these misrepresentations in an 1848 letter to Van\\r\\nAsselt:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>I am pleased that you have asked me to report concerning our\\r\\ncolony because some people look down upon it.

Carpenters have\\r\\na lot of work here, and they earn a dollar per day. Brickmasons earn\\r\\nthat same wage, but they have less work as there are not many bricks\\r\\nhere yet. There is not much work for painters because we have as yet\\r\\ntoo few nice houses. Work is beginning to improve for tailors, and it is\\r\\nalso good for shoemakers. There is much work here for the blacksmith\\r\\nand wheelmaker. Laborers earn fifty cents per day working from 7\\r\\nA&dot;M&dot; to 6 P&dot;M&dot; &mdash; and work of all sorts is becoming more available.\\r\\nAt first there was not much work here, and even farmers had too\\r\\nlittle. One reason for that is because there is less wood to be cut here\\r\\nthan in other colonies. But, even though the prairies and farmlands\\r\\nare without forests, the countryside is beautiful. The roads are good\\r\\nenough for transportation, but we have not yet harvested a crop</i><note ref=\\\"1\\\">1 <i>Meyer's letter is dated June 20, 1848, and the Scholte group did not arrive in Pella until August\\r\\n1847.</i></note> <i>to\\r\\nuse them.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>If you had come here with us, you could have had a good job\\r\\nhelping a doctor, and then your trust in Scholte would not be\\r\\nshaken....

An immigrant who visited Scholte's\\r\\ncolony in 1887 wrote:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Pella is a city of trees. Among the trees that adorn the city are\\r\\nmany fruit trees.... Pella and its environs is a land of corn and\\r\\nswine. The corn harvest is immense, and hogs are raised by the\\r\\nthousands. They are shipped live to Chicago where they are processed\\r\\nby the big meat packing companies. Herds of beef cattle are also sent\\r\\nto the market from Pella.... Farmers are proud of their cattle and\\r\\nconstantly seek to improve the breed. They even import cattle from\\r\\nFrance and Norway.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLong before 1887, however, land prices near Pella had risen sharply,\\r\\nand newly arriving immigrants tended to bypass Scholte's colony in favor of\\r\\nless-expensive land further west. Already in 1869 a group of Pella's residents\\r\\n<page n=\\\"84\\\">\\r\\ntraveled westward in search of unsettled land which could be acquired from\\r\\nthe government. They located rich soil in Sioux County near Iowa's\\r\\nnorthwestern border. Sioux County was three hundred miles west of Pella, a\\r\\ndistance that effectively destroyed daily interrelationships between the new\\r\\ncolony and its parent. Thus, in 1870, when these settlers established\\r\\nOrange City, they quickly organized a church and the essential businesses\\r\\nconnected with agricultural activity.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis process was reenacted time and again during the nineteenth and\\r\\nearly twentieth centuries: more than one hundred similar Dutch colonies\\r\\nwere established across the Mississippi River. Westward they stretched to the\\r\\nPacific Ocean. From Texas they extended northward into Canada. Many of\\r\\nthese colonies failed, and none of them became large urban centers. But\\r\\nthose that succeeded survived as small rural communities serving an\\r\\nagricultural clientele.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D053\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLand attracted these pioneers, vast stretches of unclaimed land that\\r\\ncould be acquired under the Homestead Laws enacted in 1862. Using this\\r\\nlegislation, a family could gain title to 160 acres by merely occupying and\\r\\ncultivating their holdings for five years. This opportunity came too late for\\r\\nthe founders of Pella, but Dutch settlers who moved into Sioux County took\\r\\nfull advantage of the Homestead Laws, acquiring 24,320 acres in 1869.\\r\\nDescribing that area as it appeared to him in 1872, E&dot; J&dot; G&dot; Bloemendaal,\\r\\nwho immigrated from Gorssel, wrote:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>When we stood on top of the low hills and viewed the area in\\r\\nthe region surrounding Orange City, the landscape was simply\\r\\nbewitching.

The soil is so rich that it needs no fertilizer for the first\\r\\n20 years. It is neither clay nor sand. They call it muck. It is not\\r\\nheavy and can be worked easily with a team of horses.

Soon the growing stream of\\r\\nDutch immigrants was forced to move to other parts of the county,\\r\\nestablishing additional towns. Sioux Center originated in 1871, Hospers in\\r\\n1873, Maurice in 1884, and Hull in 1895. In South Dakota, just over the\\r\\nBig Sioux River, additional Dutch settlements sprang up in the 1880s; while\\r\\nNebraska, another neighboring state, had already attracted settlers from\\r\\nWisconsin in 1870. Nearly all these settlements were located on railroad\\r\\nlines, and each acquired its own Dutch church and essential business\\r\\nestablishments.

In 1889 he reported\\r\\n<page n=\\\"88\\\">\\r\\nconfidentially that he had saved $8.25 in just one week, and although that\\r\\nwas extraordinary, he could expect an average income of $20 per month.\\r\\nMost importantly, Nijhuis claimed that he could save most of his wages\\r\\nbecause he only needed to pay cash for clothing and tobacco. Urging his\\r\\nfriend to join him in Iowa, Nijhuis promised:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>If you have the desire to come and can't earn as much in one\\r\\nsummer as it costs for a round trip, I will give you the return passage.\\r\\nBut I have no worry about that. Once you come here you will be glad\\r\\nto stay.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFour years later, Nijhuis continued to encourage immigration:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Why don't you come to this country? If you don't like it you\\r\\ncan go back. There is demand for hired hands this fall if you have\\r\\nenough money to come. Don't be afraid that you won't get enough to\\r\\nreturn. I now earn $25 per month and $20 in the winter. I could go\\r\\nback to Holland every winter and still have twice as much left over as\\r\\nyou. The reason I don't come back is not for fear of the ocean. I\\r\\ndon't worry about that. But I worry about spending all my savings.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAvailable records do not demonstrate that Nijhuis visited the\\r\\nNetherlands, but if he did, it was probably to find a wife. In each of his\\r\\nletters he urged his friend to report \\\"how things stand with all the boys and\\r\\ngirls I know,\\\" and on one occasion he wrote, \\\"There are not very many girls\\r\\nhere.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOthers, however, found the supply of Dutch girls very adequate. J&dot;\\r\\nOosteralting declared that he would not return to Erm, Drenthe, to find a\\r\\ngirl because \\\"there are enough here in America, and most of them are Hollanders.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nYoung men like Nijhuis and Berghuis were certainly able to\\r\\naccumulate capital, but deciding where they could most successfully begin\\r\\nfarming was more complicated. They all recognized the outstanding fertility\\r\\nof Sioux County soil, but could not readily purchase the costly land of that\\r\\ndistrict. Thus, many moved and invested their savings in neighboring states.\\r\\nOf his friends Nijhuis reported that one had gone to Mexico, and another\\r\\nto Minnesota.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nJ&dot; Brouwer, who immigrated from Andrijk in 1888, examined several\\r\\nlocations before selecting a permanent home in Iowa. His search began in\\r\\nRoseland, Illinois, which he found too expensive and crowded. He\\r\\ncomplained that the place he had rented for ten dollars per month didn't\\r\\neven have enough space to raise a few potatoes. Within one year he moved\\r\\nto Orange City, Iowa, where he rented a fifteen-acre farm for fifteen dollars\\r\\nper month. But after a short time he found a larger farm of one hundred\\r\\nsixty acres. After consulting with several members of his family and the\\r\\nDominie, he purchased the farm and continued to cultivate it for eleven\\r\\nyears. Due to the rising value of Orange City land, Brouwer sold his farm at\\r\\n<page n=\\\"89\\\">\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I33.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"map\\\">\\r\\na handsome profit in 1899. He then purchased a smaller eighty-acre farm in\\r\\nHornick and used the balance of his cash to pay off debts and provide\\r\\nassistance to each of his children.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn Hornick, only sixty miles south of Orange City, land sold for\\r\\ntwenty dollars per acre, while Brouwer's farm had sold for forty-four dollars\\r\\nper acre. Hornick was an essentially American community; there Brouwer\\r\\njoined a small nucleus of twenty-four Dutch families who had also purchased\\r\\nthe inexpensive land of that region.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>South Dakota: Free Land</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFarms in South Dakota and Nebraska, however, could be acquired for\\r\\nmuch less money than those in Iowa. Immigrants who had little cash or\\r\\ncredit found these regions very attractive. Albert Kuipers, who immigrated\\r\\nto South Dakota in 1882, vigorously publicized the opportunities in that\\r\\nregion. Although born in poverty, he had farmed a small piece of heath\\r\\n<page n=\\\"90\\\">\\r\\nland in Drenthe with some success. But after arriving in South Dakota, he\\r\\nwrote glowing reports of success in Charles Mix County, where he and his\\r\\nson had settled. The <i>Nieuw Advertentieblad</i> in Friesland published Kuipers's\\r\\naccount of Roelof Bartelds's experience of 1888. Bartelds was the poorest\\r\\nimmigrant to accompany Kuipers to South Dakota. \\\"He was a poor peat\\r\\ndigger from Zuidwolde (Drenthe),\\\" who with his two children had to work a\\r\\nfull year to pay for their passage to America.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D059\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAfter working to pay off these debts, Bartelds, with Kuipers's\\r\\nassistance, found a piece of open land. Kuipers wrote:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>In the spring of 1882 Bartelds came to me and asked me if\\r\\nthere were any open lands in my neighborhood. I am in constant\\r\\ncommunication with the land office, and thus I always know what\\r\\nland is available. I showed him a piece of land near us in Platte Creek\\r\\nof about 160 acres for which he had to pay $15.50 to have it surveyed\\r\\nand registered. He is now a farmer on this 160 acres. He has a sod\\r\\nhouse there but also a wood stable and grainery. He has 64 acres\\r\\nunder cultivation and the rest in pasture and hay. He has four horses,\\r\\nseven cows, a number of pigs, and all the necessary farm machinery,\\r\\nincluding a self-binder which both cuts and binds. In short, he is a\\r\\ngood farmer.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>If you wish to write him, his address is R&dot; Bartelds, P&dot; O&dot;</i>\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I34.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\n<page n=\\\"91\\\">\\r\\n<i>Castalia, Charles Mix County, Dakota.

The private reports of one brother\\r\\nto another probably carried far more authority. Ulbe Eringa, who\\r\\nimmigrated from Veldwijk in 1892, corresponded regularly with his family\\r\\nover twenty-five years, and such letters, passed from hand to hand, spread\\r\\ndetailed and reliable reports among Eringa's family and friends.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDuring the summer of 1892, Eringa arrived in Hull, Iowa, where by\\r\\nprior arrangement he lived with a friend named Abma. Within a few days\\r\\nafter his arrival, \\\"A woman came riding up into the yard with two nice\\r\\nhorses and a wagon.\\\" This woman, Mrs&dot; Hunt, had heard that a new Dutch\\r\\nfarmhand had arrived, and her husband needed help. Ulbe moved in with\\r\\nthis English family and wrote, \\\"They are real Americans and they speak\\r\\nEnglish, but it is very neat here and the people are very friendly.\\\" He\\r\\nbelieved that they were Christian people because they \\\"have five Bibles,\\\"\\r\\nbut, he continued, \\\"they don't read them; that is not the custom here. Also\\r\\nthey don't pray after meals. Mr&dot; Hunt does say a small prayer before eating,\\r\\nbut I don't understand him.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWithin a short time Eringa discovered a number of old acquaintances\\r\\nand friends in the neighborhood. In Orange City he met Johannes v&dot; d&dot;\\r\\nSchaaf, who had been a hired hand for Ulbe's uncle in Friesland. Then, \\\"to\\r\\nmy surprise,\\\" he wrote, \\\"Hedser Reipstra lives a half hour off from me. He is\\r\\nan old friend of mine.... He lives with a big farmer and even owns an\\r\\nAmerican carriage. He may use the farmer's horses for nothing, and I have\\r\\nridden with him three times already when he has taken me to church.\\\"\\r\\nWell satisfied with his new life, Eringa said, \\\"I am very much at home here,\\r\\nand I can hardly imagine that I am in America.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe activities of the Dutch church constantly attracted Ulbe, and\\r\\nover the years he supported its growth with time and money. In 1892 he\\r\\nattended a church in nearby Sioux Center and wrote, \\\"I almost forgot that I\\r\\nwas in America.\\\" In the same letter he said, \\\"All those things make me\\r\\nmore enthused about going to church here than in Veldwijk.\\\" It is not\\r\\ndifficult to understand this reaction. The church was the social center of the\\r\\nDutch-American community. Friends from all over the region gathered\\r\\nthere each Sunday, and after laboring among strangers, the Sunday services\\r\\nprovided a perfect opportunity to forget being in America. The church was\\r\\nalso an especially crucial institution for young men seeking a compatible\\r\\nspouse.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMaatje Riepstra, who became Ulbe's wife, immigrated to Iowa in\\r\\n1893. Although they may have known each other in the Netherlands, their\\r\\n<page n=\\\"92\\\">\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I35.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\ncourtship in Hull, Iowa, was facilitated by meeting each Sunday for worship\\r\\nand instruction. Working long hours six days each week allowed little time\\r\\nfor social activity. Thus, the church, whose explicit goals were religious,\\r\\nbecame the social center of the community. Here young people found mates\\r\\nwhile families visited and discussed the events of the previous week.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy 1894, just two years after immigrating, Eringa was able to report\\r\\nprogress in achieving the most crucial goals of his life. He had found \\\"a fine\\r\\nwife,\\\" and they were living on a 220-acre farm in Running Water, South\\r\\nDakota. He had rented the land on shares which allowed him to keep two\\r\\nthirds of the harvest for his own livelihood. In the process he was acquiring\\r\\nlivestock and equipment which he used later on his own farm. His church\\r\\nhad elected him as an elder, and he was asked to read sermons in the\\r\\nabsence of a regular minister. \\\"It is good here,\\\" he declared.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThese concerns &mdash; farm, family, and church &mdash; constituted the abiding\\r\\nsubstance of Ulbe's life. As a farmer he progressed steadily, acquiring his\\r\\nown 160-acre farm in 1899. By 1904 he had accumulated 320 acres and\\r\\nspoke hopefully of paying off the balance of his mortgage. In 1918 he was\\r\\nalready looking forward to retirement and to the prospect of his son's\\r\\n<page n=\\\"93\\\">\\r\\ninheriting the farm. During most of these years Ulbe was not land-poor,\\r\\nbecause he sold cattle and hogs for cash in Chicago. On several occasions\\r\\nhe visited the huge Chicago slaughterhouses and traveled from there to\\r\\nGrand Rapids, Michigan, where he discovered old friends whom he had not\\r\\nseen for twenty-five years. In 1910 he visited the Netherlands with his oldest\\r\\ndaughter to strengthen the familial ties which his frequent correspondence\\r\\nhad preserved. Two of his daughters became teachers, while a third, living\\r\\nnearby, married Johannes v&dot; d&dot; Wei, a farmer and \\\"a good man.\\\" Ulbe's only\\r\\nson, Pier, seemed well inclined to life on the farm, and Ulbe expected to\\r\\nleave him a goodly inheritance.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy participating constantly in the life of his church, Ulbe expanded\\r\\nhis cultural horizons. As a leading elder, he read sermons to the\\r\\ncongregation during the frequent absence of an ordained minister, and on\\r\\ntwo occasions he attended synodical meetings in New York, where he\\r\\n\\\"heard sermons from the best ministers and missionaries of the Holland\\r\\nReformed Church.\\\" These occasions, together with his business trips to\\r\\nChicago, exposed Eringa to a large part of America. Eighteen years after his\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I36.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\n<page n=\\\"94\\\">\\r\\nimmigration, Ulbe had become a solid citizen of South Dakota and the\\r\\nDutch-American community.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nRunning Water, Eringa's home, was but one of a dozen Dutch\\r\\ncommunities in the southeastern part of South Dakota. Concentrated\\r\\nprimarily in Charles Mix and Douglas Counties, these settlements never\\r\\nprospered as those in Iowa did. Drought forced many immigrants to sell or\\r\\nleave their homesteads and resettle elsewhere. Towns like Nieveen,\\r\\nFriesland, and Running Water were all abandoned. That phenomenon, of\\r\\ncourse, was not peculiar to South Dakota. Even in fertile Iowa more than\\r\\ntwo thousand towns and villages were abandoned during the first hundred\\r\\nyears of the state's existence. Villages without rail connections had little\\r\\nchance of survival, and many towns were organized by promoters who\\r\\nadvertised the virtues of their new sites only to sell land. Frequently\\r\\nrailroads founded towns on their own property and then assured the success\\r\\nof their investments by restricting access to rail transportation within the\\r\\ncompany's town, while causing nearby towns to decline.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWhen the big influx of Dutch settlers entered South Dakota in the\\r\\nearly 1880s, immigrants from several other European countries joined them.\\r\\nEach national group tended to establish its own villages, while Americans,\\r\\nmixing freely among most of the immigrants, usually controlled the\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I37.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\n<page n=\\\"95\\\">\\r\\ncounties' governmental structure. In Douglas County the Ukrainians,\\r\\nGermans, and Dutch clustered in separate national groups, while in Charles\\r\\nMix County, Dutch villages stood near others with Swedish and Norwegian\\r\\ninhabitants. Ethnic cohesion of this sort was a common feature on the\\r\\nAmerican landscape. Ulbe Eringa noted in 1903 that he had rented a 160-acre\\r\\nfarm from a Norwegian. \\\"This family,\\\" he wrote, \\\"acquired the farm 30\\r\\nyears ago for nothing (under the Homestead Law), and now they can sell it\\r\\nfor $40 per acre. This sixty-year-old couple is moving to a Norwegian city in\\r\\nMinnesota.\\\" Ulbe concluded, \\\"That is the way things are here in America.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>From Wisconsin to Nebraska</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe first Dutch immigrants to cultivate the flat Nebraska plains came\\r\\nfrom Wisconsin. J&dot; W&dot; Lefferink, who immigrated to Cedar Grove,\\r\\nWisconsin, in 1868, found little opportunity in that already-crowded village.\\r\\nWithin one year he moved to Lancaster County, Nebraska. Soon others\\r\\nfollowed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThree Te Selle brothers, who immigrated to Wisconsin in 1865,\\r\\nmoved to Nebraska by 1882. Jon Hendrick Te Selle migrated first, then\\r\\nwrote to his family in Winterswijk, describing Nebraska:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>The soil is black clay, no sand, and it has almost no\\r\\nstones... if you crush it between your fingers you find it to be very\\r\\nsoft and without any gravel.

We have not had to spend our\\r\\nsavings here, and we live tax free for five years.\\\"</i><note ref=\\\"2\\\">2 <i>Under the Homestead Law of 1862 a settler was only required to pay for the survey and registration\\r\\nof his land, and such homesteads were tax-free for five years. During that time the settler was obliged to\\r\\noccupy and cultivate his land, and thereafter he received a legal title of ownership.</i></note>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor a time Jon Hendrick's brother Harm remained in Wisconsin,\\r\\nstruggling to improve his position. In 1867 he was cultivating forty acres,\\r\\nbut had sold another thirty acres of woodland for $750. He calculated that\\r\\nearning 8 percent interest on $750 would bring more income than selling\\r\\nthe lumber. \\\"Wood is not worth much here because the cost of cutting it is\\r\\ntoo high.\\\" Writing to his brother Derk in Winterswijk, Harm Jan reported\\r\\nthat land prices were rising rapidly in Wisconsin. Land for which he had\\r\\npaid $25 per acre in 1865 was selling at $50 in 1870. It was also difficult to\\r\\nfind rental property. So Harm suggested that Derk might want to settle in\\r\\nNebraska, where their brother had moved.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNebraska had already become an intriguing option for Harm, and he\\r\\neagerly awaited his brother's detailed report on the area. In any event, he\\r\\nwanted a larger farm. He had tried to purchase two hundred acres from a\\r\\nneighbor who hoped to resettle near his family in Michigan. But the\\r\\nneighbor returned from Michigan reporting that land there was too\\r\\nexpensive and that he had decided to stay in Wisconsin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"96\\\">\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D061\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFinally news from brother Jon arrived, and Harm, reporting its\\r\\ncontents to the family in Winterswijk, said:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Brother J&dot; H&dot; is no longer here; he has moved at least 500\\r\\nmiles further west to the state of Nebraska.

Rather, it was the high price of land which\\r\\ncontinued to restrict his ambition. In 1870 he wrote that several recent\\r\\nDutch immigrants, expecting to purchase farms in Wisconsin, had been\\r\\nforced to become day laborers. Although their wage, $1.50 per day, was\\r\\nmuch higher than they could have expected in the Netherlands, these\\r\\npeople were deeply disappointed. Together with Harm, they drifted\\r\\nwestward.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHarm joined his brother on Nebraska's windy flatlands. During his\\r\\nfirst year there he witnessed one of the prairie's most dreaded hazards.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>On Sunday, October 15, we went to church in the morning\\r\\nand the wind was already blowing terrifically....

He ran as fast as he could to go home, but then he\\r\\nsaw that his house was nothing but ashes &mdash; his hay, grain, barn, and\\r\\npigs all burned. But that was not the worst. In the distance he saw\\r\\nsomething white lying on the ground, and he thought it was a calf, but\\r\\nas he came closer, he saw that it was his oldest daughter burned to\\r\\ndeath. After further search he found the two other children burned to\\r\\ndeath in the ruins of the house.

By 1876 conditions improved, and the community grew. G&dot; J&dot;,\\r\\nanother of the brothers, arrived in 1882. By that time the area had the\\r\\nregular services of a Dutch church. Its members tended to cluster near each\\r\\nother for mutual assistance and social compatibility.

His daughters found husbands among\\r\\nneighboring Dutch farmers, and his brothers also prospered. Among them,\\r\\nthe Te Selle brothers had at least twenty-five children. Their community in\\r\\nFirth grew steadily, and by 1948 the local Dutch church numbered three\\r\\nhundred families.

Several colonization efforts in\\r\\nTexas failed, and in Colorado one widely publicized venture ended in total\\r\\ndisarray.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nC&dot; A&dot; Sluys, who immigrated from Enkhuizen in 1892, joined this\\r\\nColorado venture after reading a pamphlet circulated by the \\\"Nederlandsch-Americaansche\\r\\nLand en Emigratie Maatschappij.\\\" This organization, which\\r\\noriginated in the Netherlands, extolled the virtues of land in the San Luis\\r\\nValley, describing it as the \\\"Italy of western North America.\\\" In that\\r\\nregion, the promoters promised, a farm of eighty acres could produce\\r\\nenough to pay all the farmer's obligations and provide a profit of 6-7,000\\r\\nguilders annually. After reading the pamphlet, C&dot; A&dot; Sluys and his wife\\r\\nagreed that they would like to join the emigrant society, but not without\\r\\ntheir father's consent. They asked him to read the pamphlet, with the prior\\r\\nunderstanding that they would use his reaction as a sign. If he counseled\\r\\nagainst emigration, they would remain in the Netherlands. After reading\\r\\nthe advertisement, the old man said, \\\"Even if this is only half true, I still\\r\\nbelieve that it would be better to join that venture than to remain here.\\\"\\r\\nThe credibility of the Colorado venture was further enhanced by the\\r\\nsupport it received from a respected theology professor, M&dot; Noordzij, from\\r\\nKampen. Thus the die was cast, and the C&dot; A&dot; Sluys family joined a group\\r\\nof 211 emigrants sailing toward Colorado.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nUpon their arrival the settlers were housed in two barracks, each\\r\\ncontaining a hundred people. C&dot; A&dot; Sluys reported that the high altitude,\\r\\n8,000 feet above sea level, was too radical a change for people who had\\r\\nbeen raised in the lowlands, and that at night the winter temperatures\\r\\ndropped far below zero. Then, in these compressed living conditions, scarlet\\r\\nfever broke out among the children, causing eleven of them to die. \\\"Our\\r\\nyoungest darling,\\\" Sluys wrote, \\\"a girl of eight months, was the last of\\r\\nthese.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe pamphlet which attracted these folk to Colorado proved to be a\\r\\ncomplete fabrication. Its author had never visited the site. If he had, he\\r\\nwould have recognized that the area's dry soil was totally useless. The\\r\\ndisappointed immigrants telegraphed Professor Noordzij and he responded,\\r\\n\\\"I'm coming immediately.\\\" Before he arrived, the colony split up, but a\\r\\nnumber remained together, awaiting the professor's assistance. When he\\r\\nappeared, it was agreed that they should find better land at a lower altitude.\\r\\nSome, then settled on government land near the Nebraska border.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"101\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMeanwhile, C&dot; A&dot; Sluys felt obliged to report their troublesome\\r\\nexperiences to the newspaper in Enkhuizen. When news of this sabotage\\r\\nreached the immigration society's agent in Colorado, Sluys was thrown out\\r\\nof the colony. Hearing this, Sluys's wife, whom he described as \\\"not easily\\r\\ndiscouraged,\\\" broke down. \\\"Now what must we do,\\\" she wailed, \\\"8000 miles\\r\\nfrom our family, in a land where we can hardly speak the language and\\r\\nthrown out of the colony with neither money nor food in sight, and then\\r\\nwithout a house in two days?\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSluys sought advice from an English neighbor for whom his fourteen-year-old\\r\\ndaughter had been working. Following his neighbor's advice, Sluys\\r\\nfound work with a railroad construction crew sixteen miles away. Soon\\r\\nthereafter part of the colony disbanded. Most of them received assistance\\r\\nfrom Dutch churches in Iowa and relocated in the older colonies. A few,\\r\\nlike Sluys, drifted from one place to another.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWorking by turns on railroad construction and as a farmer, Sluys\\r\\nremained in Colorado for about ten years. His farming efforts were hindered\\r\\nby conflicts over water rights (irrigation was necessary in Colorado) and by\\r\\ndistant markets. Without railroad connections his crops had to be sold\\r\\nlocally, and the sparse Colorado population produced slight demand. On\\r\\none occasion prices were so low that the local farmers burned their grain for\\r\\nfuel.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor a time Sluys worked as a gardener in Sterling, Colorado, while his\\r\\nwife operated a restaurant in their home. Finally, exasperated by the dry and\\r\\ncapricious climate, Sluys decided \\\"to move northward or toward the Pacific\\r\\nCoast.\\\" For one year he labored in Nebraska, saving money to finance his\\r\\none-thousand-mile trek to Montana. After reaching Great Falls, Montana,\\r\\nhe ran out of money and again found employment with a railroad\\r\\nconstruction gang. He became a shift boss and was forced to move westward\\r\\nwith the progress of the railroad's construction, but he gained free housing\\r\\nat each new location.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThen, in 1908, he returned to farming on government land near\\r\\nConrad, Montana, where he acquired 560 acres: Unable to locate water for\\r\\nirrigation, he sold part of this land and moved to another location in the\\r\\nConrad area. There he was quite successful.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy 1923 part of his family had migrated to Lynden, Washington, and\\r\\nSluys followed his children to that successful Dutch Colony. There, where\\r\\nthe Pacific Ocean restricted the westward movement, Sluys returned to\\r\\ngardening and cultivated several acres to provide for himself. \\\"Lynden,\\\" he\\r\\nwrote, \\\"is a good place; there is much land here close to the river which is\\r\\nas fertile as the best land in Holland for agriculture.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo choose such a lonely trek was exceptional among the Calvinist\\r\\nDutch immigrants. On one occasion Sluys wrote that he had not seen\\r\\nanother Dutchman in seven years. He did, however, communicate regularly\\r\\nwith his family in Enkhuizen, and he was happy to discover Dutch churches\\r\\nin Conrad, Montana, and Lynden, Washington.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"102\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nLynden and its neighboring Dutch settlements were among the last to\\r\\nbe founded by Dutch-Americans. Like Orange City, Firth, and Running\\r\\nWater, they were established to satisfy a constant demand for inexpensive\\r\\nland. The founding of the Washington settlements occurred in the late\\r\\n1890s, during the last days of the general American frontier. Thus, while\\r\\nopen land existed, the Dutch joined other Americans in their pursuit of\\r\\nagricultural opportunities. The most successful Dutch colonies on the West\\r\\nCoast were established by immigrants with previous experience in older\\r\\ncolonies where land had become scarce or expensive.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>The Pacific Coast</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOak Harbor, Washington, was the Dutch-Americans' first colony on\\r\\nthe Pacific Coast. Reports of that area's fertility reached the older Dutch\\r\\nsettlements after 1894, and soon settlers were arriving from western\\r\\nMichigan, Chicago, and South Dakota. They acquired farms of forty or\\r\\neighty acres, still encumbered with stumps left by lumber companies. After\\r\\nclearing the land, the settlers immediately established a church. By 1898\\r\\nfour additional Dutch colonies were located in the far northwest corner of\\r\\nWashington. Among these Lynden became the most prosperous.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn many respects conditions in the Washington colonies resembled\\r\\nthose of western Michigan in the 1850s. Opportunities for employment were\\r\\nvaried: poor immigrants could begin as laborers in the sawmills and\\r\\nfisheries. Those bent on agriculture could acquire stump land while working\\r\\nas day laborers. Others, who preferred business and trade, found markets\\r\\nand harbor facilities in the cities along the Pacific Coast.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOene Heller, who immigrated from Ulrum in 1891, settled first near\\r\\nHolland, Michigan; but in 1896, after minimal progress there, he moved to\\r\\nOak Harbor, Washington. Heller had struggled with a ten-acre farm in\\r\\nMichigan, supplementing that narrow living as a day laborer. In Oak\\r\\nHarbor he reported earning twice as much as he had in Michigan. He\\r\\nacquired land and expected to build a new house there. Meanwhile, he\\r\\nrented a house in the village of Oak Harbor. The fishing fleets that docked\\r\\nnearby often provided him and his neighbors with free fish. Heller's wife\\r\\nreported that they had acquired \\\"a whole sack full for each of the five\\r\\nGroninger families living in their neighborhood.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn 1897 Heller wrote, \\\"Many Hollanders have followed us here.\\\" He\\r\\nwas making high wages and expected to begin cultivating his land that\\r\\nspring. Comparing Washington with Michigan, he wrote, \\\"People don't\\r\\nhave to work in the cold and snow. I would not go back to Michigan for\\r\\n$1,000. That is the truth. We are all happy that we made the trip.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHeller's zeal differed little from the enthusiasm expressed by those of\\r\\nhis predecessors who discovered pleasant circumstances in Michigan, South\\r\\nDakota, and elsewhere. But the West Coast did offer an extraordinarily\\r\\nattractive climate. Lacking Michigan's harsh winters and the hot dry winds\\r\\nof the prairie states, Washington and California offered a more ideal\\r\\n<page n=\\\"103\\\">\\r\\nclimate, together with astonishingly fertile valleys. The economic potential\\r\\nin California was especially obvious, but despite several organized efforts to\\r\\nlure Dutch settlers there, no successful colony grew in California until after\\r\\nthe turn of the century.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy 1910 a small community of Dutch-Americans had settled in\\r\\nRedlands, California, where they organized a Dutch church. After several\\r\\npoor crops, many of these people resettled in Los Angeles, where they\\r\\norganized another church. Dutch communities in California began to thrive\\r\\nafter 1917, when a group from South Dakota organized a community in\\r\\nRipon and a number of Frisians settled in Bellflower. The latter quickly\\r\\nbecame a dairy center, and farmers with huge herds hired young people from\\r\\nthe Dutch communities of the Midwest as helpers. Many of these remained\\r\\nin California to establish their own dairy herds, where, as one immigrant\\r\\nwrote, \\\"they do nothing but milk the cows and sell the cream, and the only\\r\\ncrop they raise in alfalfa.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAfter World War II a large contingent of Dutch immigrants settled in\\r\\nCalifornia. An even greater number moved to Canada.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D066\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>Canada, Too</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe first Dutch-Canadian immigrants preceded the World War II\\r\\ninflux. A number of Dutch-Americans resettled in the western provinces of\\r\\nCanada during the 1890s, taking advantage of lenient homestead laws.\\r\\nAnother group of families immigrated to Manitoba in 1892; by 1913 a Dutch\\r\\ncommunity numbering approximately 1,000 people had grown in Winnipeg.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nStill other settlers &mdash; W&dot;M&dot; Bos, for example, an immigrant from\\r\\nDrenthe &mdash; were drawn to several parts of Saskatchewan. Like so many of his\\r\\npredecessors, Bos began his immigrant life as a farmhand. However, he was\\r\\nno pauper. He worked for a large Canadian farmer to gain experience and\\r\\nadditional time for selecting a favorable location. Indicating the priorities\\r\\nthat governed his land choice, Bos wrote in 1911:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Last week I went to Swift Current... and looked at some\\r\\nland.

Reporting about that event, he wrote:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>This year has brought me the purest desire of my life on earth &mdash;\\r\\nthat is, a loving wife.

But however atypical, temporary, or ultimately tarnished, Bos's values\\r\\nare precisely those which have preserved ethnic identity in Dutch-America.\\r\\nReaching from New Jersey to California, Dutch settlements of every size\\r\\nhave been bound together by their chosen denominations.

The\\r\\ninterrelationship of these two factors can hardly be\\r\\noveremphasized: in fact, no Dutch community in America has\\r\\nsurvived without its Dutch churches. Throughout the period of\\r\\nimmigration, those communities that were unable to support a church\\r\\ndisintegrated rapidly.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut the Dutch church in America was no monolith. From the outset\\r\\nit was a fragmented body; its members disagreed about theology, church\\r\\npolity, and the elements of worship. Some of these distinctions had origins\\r\\nin the various Dutch provinces from which the immigrants came, but the\\r\\nmost powerful divisions grew within the American setting. The potential for\\r\\ndenominational unity fractured on the rock of Americanization.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDutch-Americans drew the issues of their debates from their\\r\\necclesiastical experience in the Netherlands, trying, as much as possible, to\\r\\nmaintain those practices that they carried with them to the New World.\\r\\nEach church group defended its views by appealing to confessional\\r\\nstatements and practices originating in the Netherlands; innovations were\\r\\nsuspect. Thus, whenever the customs of American church life made inroads\\r\\ninto the immigrant churches, new conflicts developed.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nTo preserve and perpetuate their views, the immigrants established\\r\\nschools and seminaries that drew upon the intellectual traditions and\\r\\nresources of the Netherlands. Immigrant children who sought professional\\r\\ncareers frequently attended the schools their parents had founded.

Many of these students &mdash; especially ministers and teachers &mdash;\\r\\npracticed their professions within the immigrant communities scattered\\r\\nacross the North American continent. Thus, through successive\\r\\ngenerations, the Dutch-American community has trained its own leaders,\\r\\nwho, in turn, have preserved an essential core of the Dutch-American\\r\\ntradition.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>A Pious Folk</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPiety, the most obvious foundation of that tradition, was not peculiar\\r\\nto any fragment of Dutch-Americans. Virtually all the immigrants, Catholic\\r\\nand Protestant &mdash; from farms, shops, cities and towns &mdash; accounted for their\\r\\ndaily circumstances with references to God's pleasure and judgment. This\\r\\nattitude probably grew stronger among those who faced the uncertainties of\\r\\nimmigration, but prior to the extreme secularization of the twentieth\\r\\ncentury, Christians everywhere spoke more readily of God's hand in nature\\r\\nor in daily affairs.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D068\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nWith the passing of each old year, the immigrants frequently wrote\\r\\nreflections on the year's events.

So we stand ready to enter the new year, not\\r\\nknowing what it will bring.

For them closeness to God was a way of life.\\r\\nFear of ill health and death constantly pursued the people of the last\\r\\ncentury; few immigrant letters can be found without greetings\\r\\nacknowledging, \\\"through God's goodness, I remain in good health.\\\" The\\r\\nwords of C&dot; Snoeyenbosch demonstrate a common pattern of \\\"taking leave\\\":\\r\\n\\\"Now we will close for this time and wish you the blessings of the Almighty\\r\\non both your body and soul &mdash; for time and for eternity.\\\" When sickness\\r\\noccurred, the usual response followed the example of H&dot; Tijnes, who wrote\\r\\nin 1900, \\\"Father was seriously ill, but the Lord, who holds our life in his\\r\\nhands, and who directs all our paths, has spared him.\\\" Death, \\\"exchanging\\r\\ntime with eternity,\\\" required more lengthy reports, but they commonly\\r\\nconcluded with the firm conviction that all would be well because \\\"the Lord\\r\\nreigns.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe immigrants applied this matter-of-fact dependence on God's\\r\\nprovidence to virtually every facet of their lives. In 1850 G&dot; Heerspink\\r\\nwrote, \\\"I also wish to tell you that under the wise and all-ruling providence\\r\\nof God, I have married Fenna Bouwkamp on the tenth of this month.

Poor harvests or destructive storms\\r\\nwere understood as tests of faith or, perhaps, the consequence of sin. Pious\\r\\nfolk often agreed that a severe national crisis demonstrated God's\\r\\nchastisement. During the bloody American Civil War Peter Baden wrote,\\r\\n\\\"The country is in a miserable situation; God is bringing judgment on its\\r\\nsons because they have neglected His laws.\\\" H&dot; Gruppen understood the\\r\\neconomic depression of the 1930s as another of God's chastisements and\\r\\nsaid, \\\"If the people show more respect for God, perhaps he will take the\\r\\nproblem away.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"110\\\">\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D069\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>Flee The Future Wrath</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe earliest immigrants, those arriving before the 1870s, expressed\\r\\ntheir piety more openly than the second wave of newcomers.

Often a large part of their correspondence\\r\\nconsisted of pious exhortations. For these, Christianity was more a matter of\\r\\ninner feelings than an acquiescence to God's will. P&dot; J&dot; Oggel, one of Van\\r\\nRaalte's students from Axel, wrote of Rev&dot; H&dot; J&dot; Budding: \\\"He says what is\\r\\ngoing on in his own heart, and so far as I know, he is very trustworthy.\\\"\\r\\nBudding, a restless itinerant, was well-known for his independent\\r\\n<page n=\\\"111\\\">\\r\\nspiritualism.

P&dot; Lankester, who\\r\\nattended a revival in 1865, reported:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>A few weeks ago a minister, sponsored by the [RCA] synod,\\r\\narrived here.

We like that\\r\\nbest. We belong to the English Congregational or Presbyterian Church.\\r\\nThat is most like the big Reformed Church in Holland.\\\" To join an\\r\\n\\\"English\\\" church was rather uncommon among Dutch immigrants, but\\r\\nchoosing a church because of its similarity to a familiar church in the\\r\\nNetherlands was a very common immigrant pattern. Almost without\\r\\nexception the immigrants sought and joined those churches that seemed\\r\\nmost like the churches they had left behind. And when no satisfactory\\r\\ninstitution seemed available, they organized new churches and\\r\\ndenominations.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDuring the first decades of immigrant experience, Dutch-Americans\\r\\njoined or organized a variety of denominations. Van Raalte led most of the\\r\\nwest Michigan colony into a union with the Reformed Protestant Dutch\\r\\nChurch which had originated in New Amsterdam during the seventeenth\\r\\ncentury. But two congregations in the Michigan colony had difficulties with\\r\\nVan Raalte's leadership and joined the Presbyterian denomination. In 1857\\r\\nanother segment rejected Van Raalte's decision to affiliate with the\\r\\nReformed Protestant Dutch Church and organized a new denomination, the\\r\\nWare Hollandsch Gereformeerde Kerk.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nSimilar divisions developed in Wisconsin. Rev&dot; Pieter Zoone\\r\\ninfluenced several congregations to affiliate with the Presbyterian\\r\\ndenomination. Other churches followed Van Raalte's example, while still\\r\\nothers joined the newly formed Ware Hollandsch Gereformeerde Kerk. In\\r\\nOostburg, Wisconsin, one small congregation followed the advice of a lay\\r\\nminister, K&dot; J&dot; Van Aagtekerk, and remained completely independent.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn Iowa, H&dot; P&dot; Scholte also remained independent, but his followers\\r\\nwere dissatisfied with that arrangement and scattered in many directions.\\r\\nWriting from Pella in 1862, John Witzenburg declared:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Now friends, I will close, for if I begin to talk about church\\r\\nlife, I won't know where to stop.

And all this\\r\\namong intelligent people with much knowledge so that I often marvel\\r\\nhow things could have come to such errors.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nCharacterizing the situation in 1859, Maria Brandt wrote from the\\r\\nsmall Wisconsin village of Town 8, \\\"There is still much division among the\\r\\nHollanders in America, most of it pertaining to religion.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>A Tale of Two Denominations</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis confusing situation continued into the 1870s, but thereafter two\\r\\ndenominations attracted the loyalties of most immigrants. Van Raalte\\r\\n<page n=\\\"114\\\">\\r\\nspearheaded a movement to form an ecclesiastical bond with the Reformed\\r\\nProtestant Dutch Church, known today as the Reformed Church in\\r\\nAmerica. Most of the early immigrants followed Van Raalte's leadership and\\r\\njoined this church group. Originating in the seventeenth century, this\\r\\ndenomination was quite Americanized. They had adopted the English\\r\\nlanguage in worship and supported some of the revival techniques prevalent\\r\\namong the evangelical churches of America. Further, since revivals were\\r\\nessentially interdenominational efforts, the Reformed Church in America\\r\\nassociated more readily with other church groups and developed a somewhat\\r\\necumenical posture. These developments provided a comfortable situation\\r\\nfor not only the more pietistic early immigrants but also later immigrants,\\r\\nwho preferred a more rapid pace of Americanization.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nImmigrants adhering more tenaciously to the ecclesiastical patterns of\\r\\nthe Netherlands tended to join the <i>Ware Hollandsch Gereformeerde Kerk,</i>\\r\\nknown today as the Christian Reformed Church. This denomination\\r\\ncontinued using the Dutch language in worship well into the 1930s. It has\\r\\nmaintained official connections with the <i>Gereformeerde Kerken</i> in the\\r\\nNetherlands from 1882 to the present, and it has opposed adopting the\\r\\nrevival techniques which the immigrants frequently identified with\\r\\nMethodism.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nMany of the immigrants who were part of the second great stream of\\r\\nimmigration from the Netherlands, 1880-1920, joined the Christian\\r\\nReformed Church. The familiar language, pattern of worship, and\\r\\nconnection with the <i>Gereformeerde Kerk</i> in the Netherlands combined to\\r\\nmake this choice attractive. Moreover, the already-established immigrants of\\r\\nthe earlier period dominated the western segment of the Reformed Church\\r\\nin America. So immigrants of the late-nineteenth century were able to\\r\\ninfluence the character of the Christian Reformed Church more readily\\r\\nthan they could influence the larger and well-established Reformed Church.\\r\\nAlso, as one might expect, social tensions developed between the older and\\r\\nnewer immigrants, and the newer immigrants maintained their identity by\\r\\njoining the Christian Reformed Church. During the decade of heaviest\\r\\nimmigration from the Netherlands (53,000 between 1880-1890), the\\r\\nmembership of the Christian Reformed Church grew from twelve thousand\\r\\nto fifty-three thousand.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn any case, during the whole period of immigration, new arrivals had\\r\\nto choose which denomination they would join. Whatever their choice, the\\r\\nimmigrants used the churches to preserve their religious convictions and\\r\\ninstruct their children along traditional lines. Thus the church and its\\r\\nminister became the crucial core of the Dutch-American community.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>Church Talk</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe details of church life &mdash; the coming and going of ministers,\\r\\nelection to church offices, and the building or enlargement of sanctuaries &mdash;\\r\\nappeared constantly in the immigrants' correspondence. Perhaps some of\\r\\n<page n=\\\"115\\\">\\r\\nthis \\\"church talk\\\" followed a desire to convince relatives in the Netherlands\\r\\nthat immigration had not weakened the faith. Writing directly on that point\\r\\nin 1855, Markus Nienhuis asserted, \\\"But you must not think that the\\r\\nworship of God is forgotten here. Oh no! I believe, in fact, that it is\\r\\nmaintained better here than in Holland.\\\" Few correspondents were willing\\r\\nto generalize so broadly as Nienhuis, but most of the immigrants\\r\\ncommented on the quality of their ministers and the importance of church\\r\\nconnections.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe letter of Jan Spoelstra, written shortly after his arrival in 1890,\\r\\nprovides a typical example. He said, \\\"We enjoy the great blessings of health,\\r\\nfood, and all our necessities, and in addition we are permitted to hear the\\r\\nprecious Word of God proclaimed each Sunday by a true servant of the\\r\\nLord.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nParticipation in church activity was always newsworthy, but\\r\\nimmigrants took special delight in reporting that their children were also\\r\\nactive church members. Klaas Niemeijer was pleased to announce that his\\r\\ndaughter, Henderika, had acquired status as a musician. He wrote, \\\"When\\r\\nwe have a celebration, she has to sing a solo, the first two lines of every\\r\\nverse, and then the whole class joins in. She sings surprisingly well, and she\\r\\nhas already sung four times in church.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBeing able to announce that a son or brother had become a minister\\r\\nwas probably the most newsworthy event in a Dutch-American family.\\r\\nMaartje Nieveen Smit, in Platte, South Dakota, proudly reported, \\\"My son,\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I45.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\n<page n=\\\"116\\\">\\r\\nSieuwke, is now ready to be a Dominie.

In that category the children of Willem\\r\\nand Jane Walvoord may have set a record. Reporting these events, the proud\\r\\nmother of the Walvoord girls wrote, \\\"Our oldest daughter, Drieka, who is\\r\\nmarried to Rev&dot; Klerk, lives in Clymer, New York....

This school,\\r\\nfounded in 1876 to train the ministers of the Christian Reformed Church,\\r\\nwas the second theological school established by the nineteenth-century\\r\\nimmigrants. Western Theological Seminary in Holland, Michigan, started\\r\\ntraining ministers in 1866 and by 1869 had gained official status as a\\r\\nseminary of the Reformed Church in America. These two theological\\r\\nschools, together with their undergraduate departments, have guided the\\r\\ndenominations which gave them birth.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe older of the two institutions, Hope College and Western\\r\\nTheological Seminary, owes its existence to A&dot; C&dot; Van Raalte. He donated\\r\\nthe land on which the first buildings were constructed, and he negotiated\\r\\nwith synodical representatives to acquire denominational sanction and\\r\\nfinancial support for his school. Drawing upon well-trained ministers and\\r\\nteachers from the Americanized segment of the Reformed Church in\\r\\nAmerica, Van Raalte's school acquired a competent teaching staff.

Thus, throughout the whole of the nineteenth\\r\\ncentury, only five of the school's instructors were immigrants. Thirteen\\r\\nothers, including all of the school's presidents, were born and educated in\\r\\nAmerica. Thus the influence of American church life and education came\\r\\nquickly to Hope College and Western Theological Seminary. Still, the\\r\\ninfluence of Dutch theology remained strong throughout the century. The\\r\\nimmigrant ministers &mdash; Van Raalte, Vander Meulen, Bolks, de Beij, Klijn,\\r\\nand Dosker &mdash; were powerful leaders in the western segment of their\\r\\ndenomination, and they influenced the character of both their churches and\\r\\nthe seminary. All these ministers, however, were products of the <i>Afscheiding</i>\\r\\nin the Netherlands, which, because of its pietistic character, absorbed\\r\\nAmerican pietism with little difficulty. The <i>Doleantie,</i> with its more broadly\\r\\ncultural concept of Christianity, arrived too late to reorient the thinking of\\r\\n<page n=\\\"122\\\">\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I51.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\nVan Raalte and his colleagues.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Christian Reformed Church, which dates from 1857, also\\r\\noriginated under the influence of the <i>Afscheiding,</i> but this denomination\\r\\nenjoyed its greatest period of growth after 1880. Many of its new members\\r\\nwere immigrants who came from the <i>Gereformeerde Kerken</i> in the\\r\\nNetherlands. By joining the Christian Reformed Church in such large\\r\\nnumbers, they substantially altered its character. They also encouraged\\r\\nchanges in the quality of its seminary. Founded in 1876, Calvin Theological\\r\\nSeminary came quickly under Abraham Kuyper's influence. Throughout the\\r\\nnineteenth century the school drew its instructors from the Netherlands.\\r\\nThe first four professors were trained at Kampen and emphasized the\\r\\ndoctrinal concerns of the <i>Afscheiding.</i> But Geerhardus Vos, who came to the\\r\\nschool in 1890, carried fresh ideas to Grand Rapids. He had developed\\r\\nstrong attachments to Abraham Kuyper while studying in the Netherlands,\\r\\nand became Kuyper's American spokesman. The introduction of Kuyperian\\r\\nprinciples caused considerable controversy in the seminary and church. The\\r\\nolder ministers, L&dot; J&dot; Hulst, G&dot; Boer, W&dot; Hemkes, and F&dot; Ten Hoor, resisted\\r\\nthis new infusion of Dutch theology.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D080\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>Abraham Kuyper: Influence from Abroad</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nRev&dot; J&dot; Vander Mey, who studied under Geerhardus Vos, wrote a letter\\r\\nto Abraham Kuyper in 1896, paying tribute to his intellectual father:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Almost all the ministers of our church who were educated in\\r\\nAmerica embrace your principles. This has two causes. First, the\\r\\neducation under Boer and Hemkes was in every sense poor. After the\\r\\ngraduates became ministers, they felt the lack of sound knowledge,\\r\\nand when they entered their congregations, they tried to improve</i>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"123\\\">\\r\\n<i>themselves through continued study. And what did they use? They\\r\\nused the works of Abraham Kuyper! Secondly, those who were\\r\\neducated by Dr&dot; Geerhardus Vos have come to your side as a\\r\\nconsequence of the powerful training they enjoyed under Dr&dot; Vos&dot; Dr&dot;\\r\\nVos led us to Dr&dot; Kuyper.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>I also acquired my training from Dr&dot; Vos&dot; Thus, I too have\\r\\nbecome an admirer of Dr&dot; Kuyper. Please excuse me, dear teacher,\\r\\nthat I proclaim my inner feelings to you. I can never tell you how\\r\\nlarge a place you occupy in my heart. But, how can it be otherwise? I\\r\\nread almost everything you write.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAs Vander Mey's letter suggests, many of the older ministers schooled\\r\\nat Kampen rejected the new views, but in the long run Kuyper's influence\\r\\nprevailed. Although G&dot; Vos left Grand Rapids to join the theological\\r\\nseminary of Princeton in New Jersey, many students followed him to receive\\r\\npost-graduate instruction. Many others traveled to the Netherlands and\\r\\nattended the Free University of Amsterdam. Between 1902 and 1948 twelve\\r\\ninstructors were appointed to the faculty of Calvin Seminary; and all but\\r\\none of these attended the Free University or Princeton, where Geerhardus\\r\\nVos continued teaching until 1932. Thus Abraham Kuyper did not lack\\r\\ndisciples in the New World. Nor were his admirers confined to the\\r\\nChristian Reformed Church.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D081\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"letter\\\">\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNicholas M&dot; Steffens, a professor at Western Theological Seminary in\\r\\nHolland, Michigan, also supported Kuyperian ideas. He maintained\\r\\nconnections with G&dot; Vos in Grand Rapids and corresponded frequently with\\r\\nAbraham Kuyper. Both Steffens and Vos had difficulty persuading their\\r\\ncolleagues to adopt Kuyperian views. Writing to Kuyper about this problem\\r\\nin 1891, Steffens said:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Dr&dot; Vos has a more conservative surrounding than I, but he is\\r\\nunderstood by his colleagues &mdash; even though these well-meaning people\\r\\nare poorly educated and narrow minded. Momentarily Vos is plagued\\r\\nin the Wachter because of his supralapsarian viewpoint. Actually,\\r\\nRev&dot; Hulst is not concerned with Vos's views, but he uses Vos to\\r\\nattack you. It is a pity that the young man, Vos, wastes his power in\\r\\nsuch a place. Had he stayed in the Netherlands, he could have\\r\\ncontributed much more. He is no leader of public affairs, but he is\\r\\nconscientious and works diligently. There is nothing but praise to be\\r\\nsaid for his principles. I love him.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nOf his own circumstances, Steffens wrote:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>Even our own paper,</i> The Hope, <i>is in the hands of a clique\\r\\nwhich does everything to prevent me from explaining Reformed\\r\\nprinciples. I have a group of articles in my file which have been\\r\\nrejected by the editorial committee. Sometimes I don't know what to\\r\\ndo. It is obvious that here in this \\\"free\\\" America, you can find</i>\\r\\n<page n=\\\"124\\\">\\r\\n<i>tyranny which opposes the work of the Lord.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn general Steffens regarded the American setting as inhospitable to\\r\\nReformed and Kuyperian influences. Apparently A&dot; Kuyper considered the\\r\\npossibility of leading a group of immigrants to America in the 1880s, but\\r\\nSteffens advised strenuously against this:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>I can understand how you may think that it might be better to\\r\\nlead your Reformed people to Africa or North America, but don't\\r\\ngive it serious thought. There is little in America to offer hope, even\\r\\nthough I would personally love to have you and your people among\\r\\nus.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>I know the strife is fierce, but you have a better prospect for\\r\\nsuccess in the Netherlands than here in America. We are on a path\\r\\nhere which you would have to struggle against.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>I say it confidentially, but it is true, that in the Presbyterian\\r\\nand Reformed Churches of America the modern and conciliatory\\r\\nspirit is spreading quickly. When you try to oppose this spirit, the\\r\\ncolumns of the newspapers are closed to you. Not long ago I\\r\\nattempted to get something printed in the</i> New York Observer <i>in an\\r\\neffort to oppose the violation of the doctrine of justification by faith\\r\\ncaused by the new evangelical methods, but the door was closed.\\r\\nThus it is so, that as foreigners, the Hollanders can exercise little\\r\\ninfluence over the theological developments of the nation. They are\\r\\neither lost within the nation, or they remain strangers &mdash; protesting\\r\\nagainst all things American.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nPerceptively, Steffens raised the central issue facing all immigrant\\r\\ngroups in America, and among Dutch-Americans the debate over\\r\\nAmericanization has continued to the present. Vander Mey expressed the\\r\\nnature of that dilemma with exceptional clarity. Writing to A&dot; Kuyper in\\r\\n1896, Vander Mey complained:\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<i>As Reformed Christians we face a dark future here in America.\\r\\nPeople in the Netherlands have no idea how the whole of America\\r\\ndrinks from the fountains of Methodism, and the young people in our\\r\\nchurch also lean in that direction. We scarcely know how to preserve\\r\\nthem. If, as many prefer, we choose to remain isolated as Hollanders,\\r\\nwe will be signing our own death warrants. But the other option &mdash;\\r\\nswift Americanization &mdash; often results in more disastrous\\r\\nconsequences.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</bl>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDutch Americans have found no single answer to Vander Mey's\\r\\ndilemma, but with varying success they have attempted to retain what they\\r\\nconsider best in their ethnic tradition. Among those whose Netherlandic\\r\\nroots are most directly connected with the <i>Afscheiding</i> of the 1830s,\\r\\nAmericanization is more complete. For these Dutch-Americans the church\\r\\nconstitutes the most direct link with an ethnic past. But, as we have seen,\\r\\n<page n=\\\"125\\\">\\r\\nthe <i>Afscheiding</i> was a simpler and more narrow interpretation of Christian\\r\\nlife than was the <i>Doleantie.</i> Thus the <i>Afscheiding,</i> with its concern for piety\\r\\nand pure doctrine, could more readily adapt to American society. The\\r\\n<i>Afgescheidenen</i> were also among the earliest immigrants, and their\\r\\ndescendants have had more time to adjust their views to the American\\r\\ncontext.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDutch immigrants attached to the <i>Doleantie</i> have approached the\\r\\nproblem of Americanization more aggressively than those who arrived\\r\\nbefore the 1880s. Although willing to join American society, many of\\r\\nAbraham Kuyper's followers hoped to influence the institutions of North\\r\\nAmerica by establishing separate schools, labor unions, political parties,\\r\\nand newspapers. They believed that Christians outside of the Dutch-American\\r\\ncommunity could be attracted to these institutions. But, aside\\r\\nfrom the Christian school, these efforts have enjoyed small success.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe Christian school, however, has continued to grow, supported by\\r\\nboth a Holland and a general American constituency. Christian Schools\\r\\nInternational, an organization that encompasses more than three hundred\\r\\nschools and more than sixty thousand students, has attempted to preserve\\r\\npart of the Kuyperian view in American society. Staffed primarily by\\r\\ngraduates of Dutch-American colleges, the Christian schools attempt to\\r\\nlead successive generations along paths that originate from both the\\r\\n<i>Afscheiding</i> and the <i>Doleantie.</i>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThis dual tradition has been the source of some tension in the Dutch-American\\r\\ncommunity. The western congregations of the Reformed Church\\r\\nin America, those that originated in Van Raalte's era, have emphasized\\r\\npersonal piety and doctrinal purity more than the eastern segment of the\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I52.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\n<page n=\\\"126\\\">\\r\\ndenomination; while the doctrinal-pietistic traditions of the Christian\\r\\nReformed Church have blunted the influence of Abraham Kuyper's\\r\\nDoleantie. Additional complications have arisen from the American\\r\\ncontext in which those churches have developed. Nonetheless, both\\r\\ndenominations continue to bear the clear imprint of their Netherlandic\\r\\norigins.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n<part id=\\\"S9831-D082\\\">\\r\\n<div3 name=\\\"\\\" type=\\\"editorial\\\">\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n<b>The Road Ahead</b>\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</head>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nFor rather obvious reasons nineteenth-century Holland-American\\r\\nimmigrants have experienced relatively few difficulties in their adopted land.\\r\\nFirst, they were northern Europeans whose appearance and general values\\r\\ndiffered little from the dominant Anglo-American cultural establishment.\\r\\nEven more significantly, Netherlanders had been present in North America\\r\\nsince the early seventeenth century, and their descendants made the\\r\\nnewcomers less conspicuous. These new immigrants also benefited from the\\r\\ntradition of acceptability and the achievements established by their\\r\\nseventeenth-century forerunners. Further, because their names were easily\\r\\nconfused with those of the original Dutch families, they acquired some of\\r\\nthe prestige which the older families enjoyed as founders and original\\r\\nsettlers.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn the United States only the English enjoyed similarly prestigious\\r\\norigins. The Spanish and French were less acceptable because of their\\r\\nCatholicism, and all other large groups of Europeans arrived after the\\r\\nAnglo-American patterns had been established. By contrast, Netherlanders\\r\\nhad preceded many English colonists, and the Dutch created their own\\r\\ncultural hegemony in New Amsterdam. Even after the English captured the\\r\\nDutch colony in 1664, immigrants arriving in that area frequently\\r\\nconformed to the Netherlandic cultural setting. Swedes, Germans, and even\\r\\nsome of the English were forced to adopt the Dutch language in order to\\r\\nconduct business. As late as the 1840s, when the \\\"new\\\" immigration began,\\r\\nfresh arrivals easily encountered Dutch-speaking guides and advisers in New\\r\\nYork and New Jersey.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nAlong with all these advantages Holland-Americans constituted so\\r\\nsmall a minority in North America that they never threatened an already-established\\r\\ncultural pattern. By contrast, the Irish entered Boston in such\\r\\nlarge numbers that they threatened and eventually captured political power\\r\\nfrom the old Anglo-American elite. Nineteenth-century Holland-Americans\\r\\ndid dominate whole regions of Michigan, Iowa, and elsewhere,\\r\\nbut they generally acquired open or sparsely populated districts, thus\\r\\nreducing the potential for cultural clash and competition.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHolland-Americans have resisted total Americanization by choice and\\r\\nnot because they were unwelcome in the centers of American life. In fact, it\\r\\nhas been easy for Dutch-Americans to drift into the mainstream of\\r\\nAmerican culture because they have always been there. Names like De\\r\\nVries, Roosevelt, Vander Bilt, and De Witt were common and frequently\\r\\n<page n=\\\"127\\\">\\r\\nprestigious when the nineteenth-century immigration began. While Poles,\\r\\nItalians, and Jews have been tempted to Anglicize their names to gain\\r\\nacceptance in American society, Hollanders have felt little pressure in that\\r\\ndirection. Peter De Vries, a best-selling American novelist, but also the son\\r\\nof a nineteenth-century immigrant, has utilized the confusion connected\\r\\nwith distinguishing the \\\"old\\\" Dutch families from the \\\"new\\\" to create a\\r\\ndelightful scene in his novel, <i>The Blood of the Lamb.</i> In this somewhat\\r\\nautobiographical story, De Vries, thinly veiled as the main character,\\r\\nWanderhope, crashes high American social circles in Chicago because the\\r\\n\\\"Americans\\\" easily confuse his name with those of the New York elite.\\r\\nWhen the Chicago socialite Mrs&dot; Winkler asks, \\\"Have you ever been\\r\\nabroad?\\\" Wanderhope answers, \\\"No, but my parents have. They've spent\\r\\nmany years in Europe.\\\" And, of course, before emigrating to Chicago,\\r\\nwhere he became a garbage collector, De Vries's father had indeed spent\\r\\n\\\"many years in Europe.\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt is true that Dutch family names often appear in lists of prestigious\\r\\nAmericans; virtually every chronicler of Dutch-American history will cite\\r\\nthe three Presidents Martin Van Buren, Theodore Roosevelt, and Franklin\\r\\nD&dot; Roosevelt, together with Senator Arthur Vanden Berg. And books like\\r\\n<i>Hollanders Who Helped Build America</i> (1942), by H&dot; M&dot; Viekke and H&dot;\\r\\nBeets,<note ref=\\\"3\\\">3 <i>This book contains biographical sketches for more than five hundred living Dutch-Americans.</i></note> demonstrate that Holland-Americans have become prominent\\r\\nmembers of every profession in America. But it is difficult to determine\\r\\nwhat degree of ethnic consciousness these people have retained; the specific\\r\\ncharacter of their contributions seldom bears a direct relationship to their\\r\\nnational origin.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nHolland-Americans have probably had the strongest influence on\\r\\nAmerican culture in the are of religious affairs. In the long run, for\\r\\nexample, the influence of the immigrant preacher T&dot; J&dot; Frelinghuysen has\\r\\nbeen vastly greater than that of Governor Peter Stuyvesant. As a principal\\r\\ninitiator of the religious movement known as the Great Awakening\\r\\n(1720-1760), Frelinghuysen, who carried his pietism from the Netherlands,\\r\\nused it to influence the character of the American religious revival. The\\r\\nconsequences of that influence can be readily observed in the activity of\\r\\nBilly Graham.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe impact of the nineteenth-century immigration remains less clear;\\r\\nbut because they occupy identifiable regions in Michigan, Iowa, and\\r\\nelsewhere, these Holland-Americans have preserved a sufficient level of\\r\\nethnic identity to influence the larger American community. Still, aside\\r\\nfrom a few isolated cases, the success of prominent individuals usually stems\\r\\nfrom that person's activity as an American rather than as a Dutch-American.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBy contrast, institutions frequently preserve pure ethnic traits.\\r\\nChurches, schools, hospitals, and homes for the aged, which spring from\\r\\nand support the ethnic family and its values, are able to enlarge a small\\r\\n<page n=\\\"128\\\">\\r\\n<figure inline=\\\"y\\\" sysid=\\\"S9831-I53.jpg\\\" link=\\\"nolink\\\" ref=\\\"image\\\">\\r\\ncommunity's sphere of influence more effectively than the ordinary\\r\\nindividual can. For example, an educational institution like Calvin College\\r\\nin Grand Rapids, Michigan, has already provided leadership among other\\r\\nchurch-related schools who reject the views of our post-Christian world but\\r\\nwish for more than mere survival through isolation. It is the influence of\\r\\nAbraham Kuyper's <i>Doleantie</i> which has strengthened the capacity of Calvin\\r\\nCollege to provide leadership in examining the cultural dimensions of\\r\\nChristianity in America.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIn recent years the growth potential for ethnic survival in the United\\r\\nStates has increased. Although the causes of this development are not easily\\r\\nidentified, they relate to a general lack of self-confidence in the centers of\\r\\nAmerican power and influence. Problems (the riots in the 1960s, the\\r\\nVietnam War, and political corruption) have forced many opinion leaders to\\r\\nreconsider their faith in progress, because the foundation of that faith seems\\r\\nless secure. First, the supposedly unlimited supply of cheap raw material,\\r\\nupon which America's wide-spread consumer economy depends, seems to be\\r\\ndwindling. Up to this moment no technological \\\"miracle\\\" has appeared to\\r\\nsignificantly alter the source or amount of available energy which feeds the\\r\\nconsumption ethos. Also, it has become increasingly evident that the\\r\\ninstitutions of democracy have not improved either the moral or intellectual\\r\\nqualities of the populace and its leaders.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nNaive though it may seem, the American Dream has been built upon\\r\\nthe twin foundations of economic and moral progress. The keystone of this\\r\\nedifice has been the public schools, which were urged to draw all people &mdash;\\r\\nblack and white; Protestant, Catholic, and Jew &mdash; into a great melting pot.\\r\\n<page n=\\\"129\\\">\\r\\nFrom this crucible educational leaders hoped to forge a new humanity whose\\r\\ncommon faith in the ideals and institutions of democracy would transcend\\r\\nall ethnic and religious difference. The rewards of this new faith were socio-economic\\r\\nadvancement, and those who believed and lived in accord with\\r\\nthe \\\"American Way\\\" were promised success.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nDuring the past two centuries many European immigrants have been\\r\\neconomically successful. They have become landowners and homeowners,\\r\\nand their children have progressed to careers in business and well-paid\\r\\nprofessions. But the potential for continued advancement of this sort seems\\r\\nto be clogging up. Hard work no longer leads automatically to improved\\r\\nliving standards. Diplomas do not insure entrance into desired professions.\\r\\nMore significantly still, those who have succeeded often find the\\r\\nmeaninglessness of their lives a source of discontent.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nIt seems probable that the cause of this disillusionment rests upon the\\r\\nrelatively scant cultural tapestry offered in the American Dream. By\\r\\nconcentrating the core of American values in political theories born in the\\r\\neighteenth century, by defining social status within the narrow band of\\r\\nmaterial consumption, American culture has offered too little substance for\\r\\nhuman satisfaction or fulfillment. One compensatory reaction to these\\r\\nlimited cultural currents may be an intensified adherence to ethnic values\\r\\nand traditions &mdash; a phenomenon which many American scholars and\\r\\njournalists have discussed recently.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe research of three prominent authors (D&dot; P&dot; Moynihan, J&dot;\\r\\nHigham, and M&dot; Gordon<note ref=\\\"4\\\">4 <i>Daniel P&dot; Moynihan and Nathan Glazer,</i> Beyond The Melting Pot <i>(Cambridge, Mass&dot;: M&dot;I&dot;T&dot;\\r\\nPress, 1963); Milton Gordon,</i> Assimilation in American Life <i>(New York: Oxford Univ&dot; Press,\\r\\n1968); John Higham,</i> Send Me These <i>(New York: Athenium, 1975).</i></note>) has confirmed the suspicion that the melting\\r\\npot formula has not dissolved America's ethnic groups and that the\\r\\nimmigrants and their descendants have maintained loyalties to both their\\r\\nEuropean and American traditions. Thus, the prospect of a continuing and\\r\\nvital ethnic awareness remains strong.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nBut more recently, in the 1980's, the astounding growth of the\\r\\nHispanic-American community (currently about 23 million) has rekindled\\r\\ndemands for cultural conformity.<note ref=\\\"5\\\">5 <i>Rudolph Vercoli \\\"The Return of the Melting Pot: Ethnicity in the United States in the Eighties.\\\"</i>\\r\\nJournal of the American Ethnic History, <i>Fall 1985, pages 9-19.</i></note> It is doubtful, though, that the general\\r\\ninterest in ethnic studies will give way to the extreme pressure for cultural\\r\\nconformity which prevailed between 1917 and 1950. Cultural pluralism will\\r\\nprobably continue to flourish as a balancing force to cultural homogeneity.\\r\\nIn any case each generation of Americans has been inclined to reexamine\\r\\nthe age-old question \\\"What is an American?\\\"\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\nThe answer to that query has never been static because the populace\\r\\nhas been in constant fluctuation. But, by merely raising the question, fresh\\r\\n<page n=\\\"130\\\">\\r\\nconsiderations arise. Among those is the possibility that America is and\\r\\nmust continue to be a pluralistic society composed of ethnic groups who can\\r\\nmake their best contributions to the general welfare by maintaining some\\r\\nnon-American values and traditions. If this is a viable model for American\\r\\nlife, the Holland-American community deserves careful scrutiny; it has\\r\\nstaked out a remarkably large territory for the continued cultivation of its\\r\\nethnic heritage.\\r\\n</p>\\r\\n</part>\\r\\n</div3>\\r\\n</div2>\\r\\n</div1>\\r\\n</text>\\r\\n</lad>\\r\\n\\r\\n\""
