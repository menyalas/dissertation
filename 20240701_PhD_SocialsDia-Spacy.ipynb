       "'May 6th Very wet morning it has stopped me from out shooting; it did not rain very late but and windy. I went down to see if the boat was all right; I found it stuck in the mud so I let it stop. A man came to borrow my gun to shoot an Eagle ha wk which he had wounded with a stick; he came back in a little while and said he could not see it but had shot a parrot. In the evening I was playing at draughts but he beat me three games so I gave it up. Sunday May 9th I went across to Hindmarsh Islan d and saw such a lot of ducks that I wished I had taken the gun with me; it is very strange you see so many on Sunday when I go out on a week day I don’t see so many. May 10th I went out very early shooting and shot a teal coming home I picke d up a Cod fish which I suppose got killed with the salt water. We gave it to a black woman. When I got back I found that poor little Herbert had died while I was away; in the afternoon I went to see if Mr Roberts would bury him. I went from there down to the beach to get some Periwinkles. I got a good many we boiled them and they were very good. Wednesday May 12th. It was a very dismal day pouring with wet; poor Herbert was buried to day. I st opped at home to mind the children. Thursday It was a very windy morning and not having much to do at the Mill I thought I might as well go out shooting so I went out and had a good bit of fun. I got one duck and three teal and had to go into the water and mud up to my knees to get them it was precious cold. I lost one of my boots in the mud and had to go puddling about for a long time before I could find it. I thought I should have had to go home with only one boot on. It turned out very we t in the afternoon I stopped home there being nothing to do at the Mill. Friday A much finer day than yesterday. This morning I sent the ducks to Mr Whiting this is twenty that have been sent. We commenced making an office for Mr Mildred to day it is to be made of wood goodness knows what we shall be set to do next I wish he would start the Mill again but I suppose he won’t just yet I expect we shall get the sack very soon; Kid got it last week. Saturday the 15th. I received a letter from Mr Schröder with the bank book. I did not get any money this evening. Sunday 16th Very windy; I went down to the boat to see if she was all right just as I got down she break away and was going off. Nothing happened worth mentioning to day. Wednesday 19th Mr Bowman came to know if I would go to work for him in the place of a man who was on the spree I told him I would come so in the afternoon Aunt and I went down to see if we could get a place for me to stop at we went to Mrs Usher’s first but she could not take me but she would let me stop for a night or two till I could a place; we then went to Mr Hudson’s and agreed to stop there. Middleton Thursday 20 Went on to work this morning it seemed very strange at first I was put to wor k on the stones and kept there all day. Next week will be my nightwatch. Saturday 22nd got Castlen to come out at four to let me go home by the truck. 24th Went to the beach to try if Nile would go in the water; he went in very well; I did not stop long as I had to go on again at six. Saturday 29th Nothing worth putting down happened I was trying to shoot with a Rifle I hit a pole once. I am very glad I have finished for this week. Monday 31st Started from the Goolwa to go to work; when I got nearly there I thought the Mill was on fire but it turned out to be an old house on this side. It was noticed first about 12 o clock Caslic woke Mr Bowman at two but he only looked out and then went to bed again; it was close to the Mill and if the wind had shifted I think it might have set the place on fire. Friday June 4 I have got along very well so far I got paid to -day. Matthews gave me a large dog a sort of Kangaroo dog. Saturday 5 I have to work to night till ten; Frank Robson was there a bit of the evening he wanted to bet a pot about his weight with the stoker. Sunday 6th June I went to Chapel in the morning with Mr Hudson. Mr Taplin preached. In the afternoon I went to see Mr Whi ting; he said Matthews should bring my money. I went with him all over the Mill. Monday 7th Went to work at one o clock. I could not go to sleep in the day; went on again at six. I was taken very poorly in the morning and have not been to work aga in this week on Thursday I came home. Friday the 11th Mr Bowman came up to see if I should be able to go to work Monday I told him I thought I should. Saturday 12th It was a beautiful day I had a walk round the jetties. Sunday June 13th Saw the stoker from Bowman’s I told him to tell them I should be down by the first truck. Aunt and I went over to Mrs Nation’s in the morning.

They were forced to give it up as it t urned out very wet. I worked till ten It was very fine when I went home. Sunday the 20 Mr Hudson lent me his mare to go home It was rather wet but I got on first rate; I went down to the boat she was all right. I was going to catch some Pigeons for Mr Bowman but Mr Gerard would not let me have the Key; he wouldn’t have the Mill opened on a Sunday he was in a precious temper about something. I started form the Goolwa in the afternoon and came home very quick. I don’t know how we are to get the boat without borrowing one to fetch it as it is about a hundred yards from the bank. My wages last week come to pounds 2 11 0 Monday I was at work from one o’clock; I went with Mr Hudson to Mr Suggs for some melons I got on the sledge to have a ride but it hitched in the stumps so dreadfully that I was glad to get off again and had to walk as hard as I could split; it is about two miles from here it was a beautiful day and we got home by one I could not go to sleep in the afternoon so I we nt digging a bit in the garden. I was very tired before it was six. Tuesday 22 I felt very tired this morning and did not sleep very well. It still keeps very fine I hope it will be so Saturday.

I heard just now that Mr Moony was killed by a bullock dray going over his head and neck about four o’clock today; but I have not heard the particulars yet. Thursday July 1 It still keeps very fine; I think the inquest was held today the verdict was accidental death; i t appears he had been to the Nob with a load of wood for Trip and went from there to Dod’s where he met a shipmate of his and I suppose they made a few nobblers together for some say he was tipsy; this man was going home with Moony to keep up the next day as it would have been twenty years since they came into the Colony. Just after they started this man was in the dray Moony jumped up on the pole of the dray when he got thrown off and the wheel went over his head.

Saturday the 19th We commenced to grind sharps about ten oclock a.m. there were a good many. When I went to dinner we tried the kite it flew very well only there was hardly enough wind I believe they nearly lost it in the sea. Finished the sharps at twenty minutes past ten p.m. I walked home then and took my Book and dog with me I went along rather fast; I had got to the other side of Thrings paddock when I saw a Policeman coming along he turned off the road had a look at me and then wished me good night and trotted on; I suppose he thought I was some runaway.
