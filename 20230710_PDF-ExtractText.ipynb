Settled various matters, and \\nthen discussed the quest ion postponed from yesterday.   Glyde urged that I had promised the \\nHouse in my opening statement that I would not take any step for the relief of the Squatters \\nuntil the Comrs. Report was in – and that giving Goyder his instructions was taking that step.  \\nBut I pointed out that my statement was that the Ministry would not shaddow forth a measure \\nfor their relief until we had the report – that sending Goyder away was not proposing a plan \\nof relief but only collecting the information that the Comrs. from the nature of  their instructions \\ncould not be supposed to furnish.  At length it was put to the Members in the usual way and \\ncarried in the affirmative Mr. Glyde being the only dissentient – This done Duffield. left for \\nGawler  and after he retired Glyde wante d to open out the discussion again and at length \\nsaid that if we were determined to carry out the decision  that he could not sign the letter and \\nat last very offensively said that if we persisted he would resign – I at once said  that we could \\nhave no alte rnative  for if upon a threat of resignation a single member of a Ministry could \\nenforce his own views against the judgement of the Majority  to what would it lead.  We broke \\nup and in the afternoon the Atty Genl called on me with a copy of a letter  he had  written to \\nDuffield but I did not read it. I said we had  but one course whatever might be the \\nconsequence and I declined to do anything until we met on Monday  \\n \\nOctober  29 Sunday  \\n \\nVery poorly remained in bed all the morning  Thought of home and became ve ry low spirited.  \\nWrote to my wife on the possibility of my not seeing her again – In the afternoon Charlie ', '\\n called to see me.  Afterwards walked over to see the Govr. and told him of my difficulty with \\nGlyde.  He quite approved of the Stand I made  He says  that at all regards I must get rid of \\nGlyde unless he gives way – \\\\Lady Daly asked if it is true as rumoured  that Connor & Miss \\nDashwell are engaged/  To bed early and sent for Ba yer  He still thinks it is my bladder that is \\naffected and not the kidneys  gave me some other medicine  He remained with me for an \\nhour and I felt better for his visit  passed a restless night with much pain.  But felt easier \\ntowards the Morning  Night hot in a violent perspiration which did me good.  \\n \\nOctober 30 Monday   \\n \\nAt the O ffice by 10 Aclock. Wrote a strong minute to the Auditor Genl. ordering him to pass \\nthe accounts of the Clerk of Assembly  until previous orders from this Office had been \\nrepealed –  Cabinet at 2.30.  all the Members present.  I laid the case before them an d Mr \\nGlyde acquiesced in the fairness of my Statement  I then said I should be glad if he Glyde \\nwould reconsider his determination. but he thinking I would not risk the breaking up the \\nMinistry and supposing that the other Members would oblige me to give r ather than run such \\nrisk refused to withdraw from the position he had taken.  He then retired and it was \\nunanimously agreed  that his resignation should be accepted. On giving him the result of our \\nconsideration of the case I told him that it was not yet to o late if he would give way but his \\npride would not let him – and he handed me a note resigning –  But it was clear from the \\nfeeling he then showed that he expected another result. and he hinted [?] that by his leaving \\nour fate was sealed – It was afterwar ds resolved that I should see Mr Blyth in the morning  \\nand after him Everard  and Ca sement  [?] were named.  Dined with the Governor and family \\nthe only other guests being Waterhouse and  Riddoc k. The Governor evidently nervous \\nspoke to Waterhouse who thinks I  did wisely  For myself I think it is a desperate step but one \\nthat the occasion needed and if I had not taken Glyde would have been my master  which I \\nwould not have submitted to for an instant.  After the deed was done I was glad to see my \\nColleagues beco me more confident.  \\n \\nOctober  31 Tuesday   \\n \\nCalled on N Blyth early  the other Brother arrived first and I was obliged to tell him my \\nbusiness – At length N B arrived and I broached the subject.  He spoke very fairly and \\nevinced a considerable amount of kindn ess evidently pleased by this further show of \\nappreciation for him  He then told me that in consequence of his pledge to his constituents \\nthat he would not disturb Goyders valuations  he could not join me knowing that this would \\nbe a part of my policy – I felt at once that he was right.  He told me however that he would \\nsupport me whenever he could consistly [?] and I feel sure he will for he is a man whose \\nword I can throughly depend upon.  I then sent for Everard who said he was afraid he was \\nnot competen t but he coquetted [?] with me for some time and then asked me to give him \\ntime to consult 2 friends.  this I of course granted. but was surprized to learn that he intended \\nto consult Glyde and N Blyth   however I could not retract  – At 1 45 met the house a nd made \\nmy statement and was followed by Glyde who misrepresented the matter as much as he \\ncould  he was however corrected by the Atty Genl. Still however it would appear by the first \\nblush that Glyde has some supporters.  Shortly before 5 received a note from Everard   \\ndeclining  I t hen sent for Casement [?] who came to the Club .  And I soon perceived that \\nGlyde had been with him. but I succeeded in shewing the false position Glyde had taken  but \\nfinding  that Casement had committed himself I put up with his  refusal  The Treasurer was \\npresent during   the whole interview –  \\n \\nNovember  1 Wednesday  \\n \\nCalled on Townsend and told him I intended asking Neales to take the Comariate  He thought it \\nthe best thing I could do under the circumstances  Saw Neales who at once  agreed.

On the Comr moving that his motio n for the consideration   \\nof the petition of the Northern Lessees  (Mineral) be considered asked for a postponement on \\nthe ground that it had been submitted to the Law [?]  Office r – Reynolds made a violent \\nspeech because Neales could not say when it had been  refined  I took up the matter  and the \\nHonble Gent  for the perilous course he was pursuing  The Comr not having been sworn in an \\nhour how could he answer such questions.  Sento also very violent in his attack on me.  \\nSeveral questions were put intending to embarrass the Govt. especially aimed at the “New \\nComr. he having been prominent in calling in question the existing mineral regulations.  I shall \\nnot be sorry if the question of the Chambers & Finke Leases are brought forward   because \\nthe more that question  is ventilated the more it will make manifest my straightforwardness in \\nthe matter and the illegal position taken by the Ministry of that day – Had a meeting to \\nconsider Goyders instructions  the matter was discussed but the final agreement was \\npostponed t ill to morrowWe appointed Dow ner  to day in Executive and his commissions \\nwere ordered to be prepared –  The fact was known all about Town in the evening  – and \\ngreat excitement prevails  dined at the Club, felt a little better.  \\n \\nNovember  2 Thursday   \\n \\nBusy with the Estimates all the morning with the Treasurer  Cabinet at 10 30.  agreed action \\nand answers for noting on the papers and prepared letter of Instruction for Goyder which was \\napproved and forwarded –  To the House where Bright gave another notice of motion to the \\neffect “that “the House disapproves of Mr. Downe r appointment and that an  “address be sent \\nto H.E the Gov requesting him to take steps to appoint” “some more suitable person”  In \\nanswer to a question from Mr. Strangeways we stated  that Mr Goyd er had been furnished \\nwith his instructions.  Blyth presented a petition against the return of Mr. Rousearle [?] for \\nLight and moved that another member of the house be appointed in lieu of the Treasurer  \\nwhich was agreed to as being the usual course   \\n \\nNovem ber 3 Friday   \\n \\nTo the Treasury early and settled with the Treasurer the estimates. that they may be \\napproved in Cabinet and be ready to lay on the Table of the House this afternoon   At. 10.30. \\nCabinet  Estimates approved.  Executive at 12 30. when Estimate s were confirmed and \\nmessage agreed to.   In consequence of great talk out of doors that our appointment of \\nDowner is not approved it was supposed that Bright would carry his motion  and the Govr. \\nsays that   if he does we cannot remain in office an hour  Th e Atty. Genl. on this proposed that \\nDowner should resign   to this I put a veto resolving that we fight the matter out and take no \\ncompromise whatever.  of this view the Govr. approves altho’ he thinks we must be beaten –  \\nTo the House and on the business b eing called on I moved that Brights motion should at \\nonce be proceeded with.  He made a most lame case  and the Atty. in a brilliant speech \\nvindicated the Govt.  Mr. Barr moved by way of helping the Govt. that the question should not \\nbe put.  but I would no t accept the compromise.  but insisted that it was due to the new Comr. \\nthat the motion should be negatived  –  My colleagues  thought I had gone too far and in this \\nview Baker and a host of others joined but I maintained the position. We therefore voted wit h \\nthe opposition against the previous motion carried by 20. to 11.  and upon the question being \\nput (after Bright had taken out the most objectionable part of the motion). we beat him by 17 \\nto 8. A great and decisive victory – I then agreed to the adjournm ent for a week after laying \\nthe Estimates on the table to shew that we were ready to proceed with the business  and that \\nwe only consulted for the convenience of the Members.

The Strathalbyn \\nTramway Bill was then considered in Committee and several   clauses agreed to.  The Jury \\nBill passed its second reading and was ordered for the 3rd. reading on a future day  Mr. \\nSoutherlands motion for a […] part of ₤100,000 to the Road Board was considered and was \\nopposed by the Govt. on the ground that we had not the money from Genl.

We had arrived at this point \\nwhen the A Genl. arrived . and He was evidently very nervous  he said we should fail if we did \\nanything that would affec t Goyders actuations.  I maintained that the question of failure \\nshould not enter into our calculations  We had a duty to perform and that if we did right \\naccording to the best of our ability. without being in any way influenced by one party or the \\nother – we need not fear the consequences.  He appeared to be immediately reassured  and \\nagreed to the plan suggested.  The question of a remission of rent was left for the time an \\nopen question.  A letter was then drafted to Goyder asking him to furnish the Comr. with such \\nsuggestions for relief that the circumstances of the case would seem to him to require.  We \\nbroke up at 5 oclock I having been employed on the question without intermission all day –  \\nTo the Bay by the Buss.  Took tea at the Singletons.

I feel satisfied that thi s is the \\nmost prudent course to pursue. and will enable our measure to assume a more elastic shape  \\nand allow of one taking advantage without danger of every feeling of liberality that the House \\ncan shew.  Arrived in Town too late for Church.  Called on the  Atty who agreed to the \\nadvisibility  of the course proposed.  We are both to concert the resolutions  and see the result \\nin the evening, so that from the two sets we may embody something ready to submit to our \\nfriends tomorrow –  1 oclock called to see the G ovr. who I found still in bed, We had a long \\ntalk about the pastoral question.

He said get what concession you can for t he \\nruns that Goyder has valued and then give 14 Years additional tenure for the other runs – I \\ntold him that such a plan would fully justify what had been said  that our measure would be \\nframed to suit the purpose of certain parties, because it was clear t hat those who held Runs \\nthat had been valued without having adjoining land would be placed in a most unfair position  \\nWhile those who like himself who had only a very small portion of his run valued would have \\nan immense advantage by an extension of tenure  for the large area of country he held \\naround it.  \\nAt last he was convinced and said he would be perfectly satisfied if we made the numer of \\nclasses 4 instead of 5.

Scott. Main – H James – & Soutter  and \\naltho they appear to agree very well there is always a certain amount of chaff going on.  Scott \\nis an undoubtedly clever fellow.  I should think Soutter the Manager of the A Bank a little \\nshallow.  H James a good humoured fellow self indulgent and only his own enemy.  When I \\nsay his own enemy I dont mean that he acts rightly to others because I expect he has served \\nothers as he has treated me by borrowing money that he will never return but in this no doubt \\nhe suffers more than the lenders suffer by loss  of credit and constant anxiety.  \\n \\nThis has probably been for me a more eventful Year than I am likely to witness again.  \\nSeparated from my wife and family  I have felt like one  alone in the World and this loneliness \\nhas been the depressing from the want of my usual health.  In business matters the Year has \\nbeen most successful which has been the more gratifying from the fact that it has resulted \\nfrom good management and that during the absence of the partner H H Hayes – who never \\ndesired that any one should have credit but himself – \\n \\nThen in consequence of my representing to Walters the connection with Hughes in the Mill is \\nat an end without a quarrel and we buy him out with little beyond the profits of the Year – \\nThen I have arranged that Connor takes a four th share and to manage during my absence \\nwithout engaging in any other transaction thus securing his undivided attention to the Mill. I \\nhave every confidence in him as a business man. but in other respects he is both weak and \\nunprincipled. Then during the Year what strange things have occurred to me politically  The \\ncommencement of he Year found me the Treasurer in the Ayres Ministry with every desire to \\nuphold him and although it was fully understood that I intended to retire for the purpose of \\njoining my f amily  still I held myself at his disposal to remain for a time or to retire when \\nconvenient  For this purpose I stood for the Port at the general election  Then when  the Atty \\nGenl. (Stow) was defeated – and the difficulty about supplying his place arose I at once \\noffered to resign to enable Ayres to make terms with Reynold or Strangeways. but not \\nexpecting that he would be ready to sacrifice our other Colleagues – Blyth & Milne [?] but to \\nmy surprise and great disappointment – He took to a new set and threw  over his loyal friends ', '\\n – joining himself to those who had been for 2 Years opposed to him –  But this arrangement \\nas might be expected could not stand .  The expressed opinions and pledges of the \\nindividuals could not be supported or redeemed by the Minist ry as a whole, and there was \\nthen apparent division and weakness in the Camp.  Reynold not only shewed that he was at \\nissue with his Colleagues on most important points but he could not help shewing his \\nillfeeling to Members willing generally to support th e Govt. and by insulting  them even as an \\nopposition that eventually brought him to grief – I certainly had no intention of supplanting \\nAyres. and yet circumstances principally caused by Ayres himself has led to my now on the \\n1st. of  Jay 1866 to holding th e Office of Chief Secretary and but that I must leave before \\ngoing into Recess I might reasonably expect to retain it many months at least  \\n \\n ']\n"

During our conference Mr Elder arrived giving  me a l etter in \\nwhich he made requisition for arms and ammunition to be given in charge to his overseer.  \\nTo which I object on the ground that the Govt. could not supply arms for use against the \\nNatives to any person who was not directly responsible to the Govt.  He appeared to be \\ngreatly annoyed and thought I was wrong in the view I had taken  I said that in the absence of \\n the Atty Genl I would consult the Govr. which I did who fully confirmed my view of the matter – \\nWrote to Mr. Swan the S.M to hold himsel f in readiness to proceed to the North  and sent for \\nMr. Walker [?] the Protector to accompany him – He appeared to be rather disclined to go but \\nI informed him that notwithstanding that his private affairs might be disarranged by his going \\nthat the public service required that he must do so – Called upon Daly about the partnership \\nbut the Office is closed until the 2nd.

       " 'December  31 Sunday  \\n \\nWeather still very hot but here at the Bay there is a freshness in the air. that is never felt in \\nTown   To Church which I was surprized to see in so unfortunate a state.

Scott. Main – H James – & Soutter  and \\naltho they appear to agree very well there is always a certain amount of chaff going on.  Scott \\nis an undoubtedly clever fellow.  I should think Soutter the Manager of the A Bank a little \\nshallow.  H James a good humoured fellow self indulgent and only his own enemy.  When I \\nsay his own enemy I dont mean that he acts rightly to others because I expect he has served \\nothers as he has treated me by borrowing money that he will never return but in this no doubt \\nhe suffers more than the lenders suffer by loss  of credit and constant anxiety.  \\n \\nThis has probably been for me a more eventful Year than I am likely to witness again.  \\nSeparated from my wife and family  I have felt like one  alone in the World and this loneliness \\nhas been the depressing from the want of my usual health.  In business matters the Year has \\nbeen most successful which has been the more gratifying from the fact that it has resulted \\nfrom good management and that during the absence of the partner H H Hayes – who never \\ndesired that any one should have credit but himself – \\n \\nThen in consequence of my representing to Walters the connection with Hughes in the Mill is \\nat an end without a quarrel and we buy him out with little beyond the profits of the Year – \\nThen I have arranged that Connor takes a four th share and to manage during my absence \\nwithout engaging in any other transaction thus securing his undivided attention to the Mill. I \\nhave every confidence in him as a business man. but in other respects he is both weak and \\nunprincipled. Then during the Year what strange things have occurred to me politically  The \\ncommencement of he Year found me the Treasurer in the Ayres Ministry with every desire to \\nuphold him and although it was fully understood that I intended to retire for the purpose of \\njoining my f amily  still I held myself at his disposal to remain for a time or to retire when \\nconvenient  For this purpose I stood for the Port at the general election  Then when  the Atty \\nGenl. (Stow) was defeated – and the difficulty about supplying his place arose I at once \\noffered to resign to enable Ayres to make terms with Reynold or Strangeways. but not \\nexpecting that he would be ready to sacrifice our other Colleagues – Blyth & Milne [?] but to \\nmy surprise and great disappointment – He took to a new set and threw  over his loyal friends \\n – joining himself to those who had been for 2 Years opposed to him –  But this arrangement \\nas might be expected could not stand .  The expressed opinions and pledges of the \\nindividuals could not be supported or redeemed by the Minist ry as a whole, and there was \\nthen apparent division and weakness in the Camp.  Reynold not only shewed that he was at \\nissue with his Colleagues on most important points but he could not help shewing his \\nillfeeling to Members willing generally to support th e Govt. and by insulting  them even as an \\nopposition that eventually brought him to grief – I certainly had no intention of supplanting \\nAyres. and yet circumstances principally caused by Ayres himself has led to my now on the \\n1st. of  Jay 1866 to holding th e Office of Chief Secretary and but that I must leave before \\ngoing into Recess I might reasonably expect to retain it many months at least  \\n \\n ']"
