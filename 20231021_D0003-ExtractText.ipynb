It was a very dismal day, pouring with wet; poor Herbert was buried to \\nday. I st opped at home to mind the children.  \\n \\nThursday It was a very windy morning, and not having much to do at the Mill, I thought I \\nmight as well go out shooting, so I went out, and had a good bit of fun. I got one duck and \\nthree teal [p. 5] and had to go into the water and mud up to my knees to get them, it was \\nprecious cold. I lost one of my boots in the mud and had to go puddling about for a long time \\nbefore I could find it., I thought I should have had to go home with only one boot on.  \\n \\n']"
