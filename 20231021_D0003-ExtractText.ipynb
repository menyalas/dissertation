I \\nwent down to see if the boat was all right; I \\nfound it stuck in the mud so I let it stop.  A \\nman came to borrow my gun to shoot an \\nEagle ha wk which he had wounded with a \\nstick; he came back in a little while and \\nsaid he could not see it but had shot a \\nparrot.  \\n \\nIn the evening I was playing at draughts, \\nbut he beat me three games so I gave it \\nup. \\n \\nSunday May 9th I went across to \\nHindmarsh Islan d and saw such a lot of \\nducks that I wished I had taken the gun \\nwith me; it is very strange you see so \\nmany on Sunday , when I go out on a week \\nday I don’t see so many.  \\n \\nMay 10th I went out very early  \\n \\n \\n[p. 4] shooting and shot a teal, coming home, I picke d up a Cod fish which I suppose got \\nkilled with the salt water. We gave it to a black woman.  \\n \\nWhen I got back I found that poor little Herbert had died while I was away; [Herbert Gerard \\ndied 10 May 1858 at Goolwa aged 13 months] in the afternoon I went to see if Mr Roberts \\nwould bury him. I went from there, down to the beach to get some Periwinkles. I got a good \\nmany, we boiled them and they were very good.  \\n \\nWednesday May 12th. It was a very dismal day, pouring with wet; poor Herbert was buried to \\nday. I st opped at home to mind the children.  \\n \\nThursday It was a very windy morning, and not having much to do at the Mill, I thought I \\nmight as well go out shooting, so I went out, and had a good bit of fun. I got one duck and \\nthree teal [p. 5] and had to go into the water and mud up to my knees to get them, it was \\nprecious cold. I lost one of my boots in the mud and had to go puddling about for a long time \\nbefore I could find it., I thought I should have had to go home with only one boot on.  \\n \\n', '\\n It turned out very we t in the afternoon, I stopped home, there being nothing to do at the Mill.  \\n \\nFriday A much finer day than yesterday. This morning I sent the ducks to Mr Whiting, this is \\ntwenty that have been sent.  \\n \\nWe commenced making an office for Mr Mildred to day, it is  to be made of wood, goodness \\nknows what we shall be set to do next, I wish he would start the Mill again, but I suppose he \\nwon’t just yet, I expect we shall get the sack very soon; Kid got [p. 6] it last week.  \\n \\nSaturday the 15th. I received a letter from Mr Schröder with the bank book.  \\n \\nI did not get any money this evening.  \\n \\nSunday 16th Very windy; I went down to the boat to see if she was all right, just as I got down \\nshe break away and was going off.  \\n \\nNothing happened worth mentioning to day.  \\n \\nWednesday 19th Mr Bowman came to know if I would go to work for him in the place of a \\nman who was on the spree, I told him I would come, so in the afternoon Aunt and I went \\ndown to see if we could get a place for me to stop at, we went to Mrs Usher’s first, but she \\ncould not take me , but she would let me stop for a night or two till I could [get] a place; we \\nthen went to Mr Hudson’s and agreed to stop there.  \\n \\n[p. 7] Middleton Thursday 20 Went on to work this morning, it seemed very strange at first, I \\nwas put to wor k on the stones and kept there all day.  \\n \\nNext week will be my nightwatch.  \\n \\nSaturday 22nd got Castlen [?] to come out at four, to let me go home by the truck.  \\n \\n24th [?] Went to the beach, to try if Nile [?] would go in the water; he went in very well; I did  \\nnot stop long, as I had to go on again at six.  \\n \\nSaturday 29th Nothing worth putting down happened I was trying[?] to shoot with a Rifle, I hit \\na pole once. I am very glad I have finished for this week.  \\n \\nMonday 31st Started from the Goolwa to go to work; when I got nearly there I thought the Mill \\nwas on fire, but it turned out to be an old house on this side. It was noticed first about 12 o \\nclock Caslic [?] woke Mr Bowman at two, but he only looked out and then [p. 8 ] went to bed \\nagain; it was close to the Mill, and if the wind had shifted I think it might have set the place on \\nfire. \\n \\nFriday June 4 I have got along very well so far, I got paid to -day. Matthews gave me a large \\ndog a sort of Kangaroo dog.  \\n ', '\\n Saturday 5 I have to work to night till ten; Frank Robson was there a bit of the evening, he \\nwanted to bet a pot about his weight with the stoker.  \\n \\nSunday 6th June I went to Chapel in the morning with Mr Hudson. Mr Taplin preached. In the \\nafternoon I went to see Mr Whi ting; he said Matthews should bring my money. I went with \\nhim all over the Mill.  \\n \\nMonday 7th Went to work at one o clock. I could not go to sleep in the day; went on again at \\nsix. I was taken very poorly in the morning, and have not been [p. 9] to work aga in this week \\non Thursday I came home.  \\n \\nFriday the 11th Mr Bowman came up to see if I should be able to go to work Monday, I told \\nhim I thought I should.  \\n \\nSaturday 12th It was a beautiful day, I had a walk round the jetties.  \\n \\nSunday June 13th Saw the stoker  from Bowman’s, I told him to tell them I should be down by \\nthe first truck. Aunt and I went over to Mrs Nation’s in the morning. She gave us some turnips \\nand onions, and told us a long yarn.  \\n \\nWe went to Chapel in the afternoon, Mr Roberts preached a very nice sermon.  \\n \\nMonday the 14th I went up to Mr Good’s this morning, to buy a new coat. I got a Plaid one for \\n39/- I went down to the Mill by the first truck. They seemed glad to see me.  \\n \\nTuesday 15 It still keeps fine and we are very busy at the mill, worki ng [p. 10] night & day, I \\nwas paid to day £3 9 10 I have not received any word form the Goolwa.  \\n \\nWednesday 16th There is nothing to put down as I am in the Mill all day. Ted Childs [?] and I \\nhave been talking about going out shooting, when we shirt [?] up;  John Thring is going too. I \\nthink we intend taking a boat and going up the River.  \\n \\nThursday 17th I received a lot of soup and my things this morning, and a note from Aunt, I \\nsent one to her to day. Sam and Mr Green are gone to this spree at Spry’s. We are  cleaning \\nout the wheat bin to day, it is full of Weavel.  \\n \\nSaturday the 19th In the afternoon Robert and Andrew went down to the beach, with the rifle, \\nto see if they could hit a mark, they neither of them touched it. They were forced to give it up \\nas it t urned out very wet. I worked till ten, It was very fine when I went [p. 11] home.  \\n \\nSunday the 20 Mr Hudson lent me his mare to go home, It was rather wet, but I got on first \\nrate; I went down to the boat, she was all right. I was going to catch some Pigeons for Mr \\nBowman, but Mr Gerard would not let me have the Key; he wouldn’t have the Mill opened on \\na Sunday, he was in a precious temper about something. I started form the Goolwa in the \\nafternoon, and came home very quick. I don’t know how we are to get the boat without \\nborrowing one to fetch it, as it is about a hundred yards from the bank.  \\n ', '\\n My wages last week come to £2 11 0  \\n \\nMonday I was at work from one o’clock; I went with Mr Hudson to Mr Suggs for some \\nmelons, I got on the sledge to have a ride but it hitched in the stumps so dreadfully, that I \\nwas glad to get off again, and had to walk as hard as I could split; it is [p. 12] about two miles \\nfrom here, it was a beautiful day and we got home by one, I could not go to sleep in the \\nafternoon so I we nt digging a bit in the garden. I was very tired before it was six.  \\n \\nTuesday 22 I felt very tired this morning, and did not sleep very well. It still keeps very fine, I \\nhope it will be so Saturday.  \\n \\nWednesday the 23 I got on pretty well last night, it was very cold. In the morning, I got a letter \\nfrom Aunt saying they were going to Kanmantoo on Sunday. They sent some jelly by the \\ntruck, and some cakes which were very nice, I got them when I went on at six.  \\n \\nSaturday 26 I went to the Goolwa in the morning af ter I got my money £5 15 6 I found that \\nthey were going of in the to Kanmantoo. [sic]  \\n \\nI told them to get a dog for me if they could, went down to the River to try my gun with balls, it \\ndid very well better than I expected. I was [p. 13] trying to catch so me pigeons for Mr \\nBowman. I got two but I had a hard job, they are very wild.  \\n \\nMr Gerard went in the afternoon for the horse; I don’t know where he got him, at Simmonds’ I \\nsuppose.  \\n \\nSunday They went off a little after nine o’clock.  It was a dull day; I sta rted for Middleton \\ndirectly after; I had a rare bundle to carry, and the Pigeons, which I left as I passed.  \\n \\nIn the afternoon, I was down to the beach, John Spry was there, making his dog go in the \\nwater, he went in first rate. Mr H. and I went to Chapel i n the evening.  \\n \\nMonday 28 I was stonedressing all day; Carlic was helping, we were loading flour in the \\nmorning.  \\n \\nWednesday 30 It is beautiful weather now; I wrote a long letter to Aunt yesterday, the Mill is \\ngoing again all right. I heard just now that Mr  Moony was killed by a bullock dray going over \\nhis [p. 14] head and neck, about four o’clock today; but I have not heard the particulars yet.  \\n \\nThursday July 1 It still keeps very fine; I think the inquest was held today, the verdict was \\naccidental death; i t appears he had been to the Nob, with a load of wood for Trip, and went \\nfrom there to Dod’s, where he met a shipmate of his, and I suppose they made a few \\nnobblers together, for some say he was tipsy; this man was going home with Moony to keep \\nup the next  day, as it would have been twenty years since they came into the Colony. Just \\nafter they started, this man was in the dray, Moony jumped up on the pole of the dray, when \\nhe got thrown off, and the wheel went over his head.  \\n ', '\\n Friday 2nd Moony was buried to day; there were a good many people there. I saw Mr Waddle \\ntoday, for the first time [p. 15] since his illness he seemed pretty well.  \\n \\nThe weather keeps very dry, the farmers want wet now. I had a letter from Aunt yesterday, \\nthey had not got a dog.  \\n \\nSaturdy  3rd I worked till ten tonight, it is my night work next week. I hope Aunts will come \\nhome this next week, I earned £2 12 10.  \\n \\nSunday the 4th I lay in bed till nearly eight o’clock. Mr H. and I went to chapel.  \\n \\nMonday 5th Mr H. lent me his horse to go to t he Goolwa to fetch my gun, as I thought of going \\nout Shooting but it was so late when I got back, that it was of no use the ride did me good I \\nthink. I went to work at one this morning.  \\n \\nWhen I was at the Goolwa Mr G. and I had a chat. Kid was there too. M r G. said Aunt wanted \\nto come home this week, if he can get a horse I suppose he will fetch them. I hope they will \\ncome.  \\n \\nTuesday 6th I am [p. 16] getting on pretty well at the night work. I got a letter from Aunt today, \\nto say they were coming home on Fri day, they did not get any rabbits; I am glad of it, as they \\nwould have been a great deal of trouble. I have been out shooting but I did not get anything I \\nonly went a little way.  \\n \\nSaturday 10th It is very wet this morning, I am glad I finished this morning  for this week; I \\nwent home by the first truck, they were come home, and had got a Kangaroo Puppy. They \\ngave a pound for it, I think it will be a good one. I got my new boots this morning they are £1 \\n3 0 I went down to the boat in the afternoon, and bailed  it out, it was nearly full of water, one \\nof the oars is gone, I don’t know who has got it.  \\n \\nMy dog is eight weeks old last Thursday.  \\n \\n[p. 17] Sunday the 11th It is very wet this morning, I did not know what to do with my self, I \\nsaw Harry in the afternoon , and told him to look out for the oar belonging to the boat.  \\n \\nMonday the 12th I came down by the truck, it was a fine day we were Grinding seconds \\ntoday, nothing happened particular.  \\n \\nTuesday the 13th I expected Aunt would have been down today. I heard today that all Mr \\nPhillipson’s things were going to be sold; Mr Bowman went down, but the sale did not come \\noff, it is to be tomorrow week.  \\n \\nThe wheat still keeps coming in faster than we can grind it; I  have not been in for this raffle \\nyet, I don’t think I shall.  \\n ', '\\n Wednesday the 14th Aunt came down today, she had got the Check changed at Mr Ray’s. I \\npaid for my books, and sent home a bushel of Pollard for the dog, I don’t know if he will eat it, \\nI hope so ; she said Mr G was going to take over some wood.  \\n \\n[p. 18] Thursday the 15th It is showery today. I got my things by the truck, I lay too long in bed \\nthis morning.  \\n \\nSaturday 17th There is Nothing worth putting down this week, Mr Gerard was down by the \\ntruck this afternoon, he brought a bundle for me, he wanted me to go down tomorrow.  \\nI worked till ten my money is £2 13 0 this week.  \\n \\nSunday the 18th A very fine day. Andrew and I st arted for the Goolwa at 11 o’clock, we went \\nalong first rate, they did not expect to see me at home, I stopped in reading, all afternoon. I \\nwent back in the evening; I had got about half way through the scrub, when I saw two fine \\nKangaroos run across the l ine; if a dog had been there, he might have caught one I think.  \\n \\nMonday the 19 I went to work at one this morning, it was cold. I went out shooting [p. 19] \\nafter breakfast, and shot six wattle birds, and had no more shot, so I had to come home with \\nthem. M rs Hudson picked them, and we are to have them for supper  \\n \\nThey turned out very tough, I got along very well in the night.  \\n \\nTuesday the 20 I went off in a hurry to the Goolwa first thing on the mare, I got back a little \\nbefore one.  \\n \\nWednesday the 21 I was precious sleepy last night, not having much yesterday. There is not \\nmuch to put down, the weeks I work by nights as I feel tired.  \\n \\nSaturday the 24th I have finished for this week; I went in for this Raffle in the evening, but did \\nnot get it, William Jones got it for young Bottomly.  \\n \\nSunday 25 Mr Gerard and I went over to the Island in the morning for a walk, we got back by \\ndinner time.  \\n \\nMonday 26 It was blowing a Gale the sea was rougher today than It [p. 20] has been since I \\nhave been here; we have been ge tting along very well today.  \\n \\nTuesday 27 Aunt was down today, she brought my cloth.  \\n \\nI bought the gun off Tom Jones today, but he has not brought it down yet.  \\n \\nThursday 29  I was trying to make a dog collar yesterday. The gun did not come down yet.  \\n \\nThe Gov ernor and his wife went down to the Nob, he called at the mill as he went back to \\norder some meal for making brown bread to take out shooting.  \\n \\nI was trying to make a spring for my shot belt. I made three but broke them all in bending.  ', '\\n Friday 30. It is turning out finer than it has been lately; Mr Gerard passed the mill to day, he \\nwas going to Mr Makey’s. I have not made the dog collar yet.  \\n \\nSaturday 30 [sic] Aunt sent a parcel [p. 21] down by the truck. Tom Jones fetched the gun, I \\npaid ₤2 0 0 for it; I  have not tried if it is a good one. I made a spring that would do yesterday. \\nMy money is ₤2 12 10 for this week.  \\n \\nSunday the 1st of August. It is my birthday; in the morning Mr Hudson and I went to Chapel; \\nwhen we came back, Mrs H was very poorly in the e vening I had to go to the Goolwa to fetch \\nthe doctor.

      "18580506. May 6th 1858 Very wet morning, it has stopped me from going out shooting; it did not rain very late but --- and windy. I went down to see if the boat was all right; I found it stuck in the mud so I let it stop. A man came to borrow my gun to shoot an Eagle hawk which he had wounded with a stick; he came back in a little while and said he could not see it but had shot a parrot. In the evening I was playing at draughts, but he beat me three games so I gave it up. \n",
      "18580509. Sunday May 9th I went across to Hindmarsh Island and saw such a lot of ducks that I wished I had taken the gun with me; it is very strange you see so many on Sunday, when I go out on a week day I don’t see so many. \n",
      "18580510. May 10th I went out very early shooting and shot a teal, coming home, I picked up a Cod fish which I suppose got killed with the salt water. We gave it to a black woman. When I got back I found that poor little Herbert had died while I was away; in the afternoon I went to see if Mr Roberts would bury him. I went from there, down to the beach to get some Periwinkles. I got a good many, we boiled them and they were very good. \n",
      "18580512. Wednesday May 12th. It was a very dismal day, pouring with wet; poor Herbert was buried I stopped at home to mind the children. \n",
      "18580513. Thursday It was a very windy morning, and not having much to do at the Mill, I thought I might as well go out shooting, so I went out, and had a good bit of fun. I got one duck and three teal and had to go into the water and mud up to my knees to get them, it was precious cold. I lost one of my boots in the mud and had to go puddling about for a long time before I could find it., I thought I should have had to go home with only one boot on. It turned out very wet in the afternoon, I stopped home, there being nothing to do at the Mill. \n",
      "18580514. Friday A much finer day than yesterday. This morning I sent the ducks to Mr Whiting, this is twenty that have been sent. We commenced making an office for Mr Mildred, it is to be made of wood, goodness knows what we shall be set to do next, I wish he would start the Mill again, but I suppose he won’t just yet, I expect we shall get the sack very soon; Kid got it last week. \n",
      "18580515. Saturday the 15th. I received a letter from Mr Schröder with the bank book. I did not get any money this evening. \n",

      "18580519. Wednesday 19th Mr Bowman came to know if I would go to work for him in the place of a man who was on the spree, I told him I would come, so in the afternoon Aunt and I went down to see if we could get a place for me to stop at, we went to Mrs Usher’s first, but she could not take me, but she would let me stop for a night or two till I could get a place; we then went to Mr Hudson’s and agreed to stop there.\n",

      "18580531. Monday 31st Started from the Goolwa to go to work; when I got nearly there I thought the Mill was on fire, but it turned out to be an old house on this side. It was noticed first about 12 o’clock Caslic woke Mr Bowman at two, but he only looked out and then went to bed again; it was close to the Mill, and if the wind had shifted I think it might have set the place on fire. \n",
      "18580604. Friday June 4 I have got along very well so far, I got paid to -day. Matthews gave me a large dog a sort of Kangaroo dog. \n",
      "18580605. Saturday 5 I have to work tonight till ten; Frank Robson was there a bit of the evening, he wanted to bet a pot about his weight with the stoker. \n",
      "18580606. Sunday 6th June I went to Chapel in the morning with Mr Hudson. Mr Taplin preached. In the afternoon I went to see Mr Whiting; he said Matthews should bring my money. I went with him all over the Mill. \n",
      "18580607. Monday 7th Went to work at one o’clock. I could not go to sleep in the day; went on again at six. I was taken very poorly in the morning, and have not been to work aga in this week on Thursday I came home. \n",
      "18580611. Friday the 11th Mr Bowman came up to see if I should be able to go to work Monday, I told him I thought I should. \n",
      "18580612. Saturday 12th It was a beautiful day, I had a walk round the jetties. \n",
      "18580613. Sunday June 13th Saw the stoker from Bowman’s, I told him to tell them I should be down by the first truck. Aunt and I went over to Mrs Nation’s in the morning. She gave us some turnips and onions, and told us a long yarn. We went to Chapel in the afternoon, Mr Roberts preached a very nice sermon. \n",
      "18580614. Monday the 14th I went up to Mr Good’s this morning, to buy a new coat. I got a Plaid one for 39/- I went down to the Mill by the first truck. They seemed glad to see me. \n",
      "18580615. Tuesday 15 It still keeps fine and we are very busy at the mill, working night and day, I was paid £3 9 10 I have not received any word from the Goolwa. \n",
      "18580616. Wednesday 16th There is nothing to put down as I am in the Mill all day. Ted Childs and I have been talking about going out shooting, when we shirt up; John Thring is going too. I think we intend taking a boat and going up the River. \n",

      "18580619. Saturday the 19th In the afternoon Robert and Andrew went down to the beach, with the rifle, to see if they could hit a mark, they neither of them touched it. They were forced to give it up as it turned out very wet. I worked till ten, It was very fine when I went home. \n",
      "18580620. Sunday the 20 Mr Hudson lent me his mare to go home, It was rather wet, but I got on first rate; I went down to the boat, she was all right. I was going to catch some Pigeons for Mr Bowman, but Mr Gerard would not let me have the Key; he wouldn’t have the Mill opened on a Sunday, he was in a precious temper about something. I started form the Goolwa in the afternoon, and came home very quick. I don’t know how we are to get the boat without borrowing one to fetch it, as it is about a hundred yards from the bank. My wages last week come to £2 11 0 \n",

      "May 6th 1858 Very wet morning, it has stopped me from going out shooting; it did not rain very late but --- and windy. I went down to see if the boat was all right; I found it stuck in the mud so I let it stop. A man came to borrow my gun to shoot an Eagle hawk which he had wounded with a stick; he came back in a little while and said he could not see it but had shot a parrot. In the evening I was playing at draughts, but he beat me three games so I gave it up. \n",
      "Sunday May 9th I went across to Hindmarsh Island and saw such a lot of ducks that I wished I had taken the gun with me; it is very strange you see so many on Sunday, when I go out on a week day I don’t see so many. \n",
      "May 10th I went out very early shooting and shot a teal, coming home, I picked up a Cod fish which I suppose got killed with the salt water. We gave it to a black woman. When I got back I found that poor little Herbert had died while I was away; in the afternoon I went to see if Mr Roberts would bury him. I went from there, down to the beach to get some Periwinkles. I got a good many, we boiled them and they were very good. \n",
      "Wednesday May 12th. It was a very dismal day, pouring with wet; poor Herbert was buried I stopped at home to mind the children. \n",
      "Thursday It was a very windy morning, and not having much to do at the Mill, I thought I might as well go out shooting, so I went out, and had a good bit of fun. I got one duck and three teal and had to go into the water and mud up to my knees to get them, it was precious cold. I lost one of my boots in the mud and had to go puddling about for a long time before I could find it., I thought I should have had to go home with only one boot on. It turned out very wet in the afternoon, I stopped home, there being nothing to do at the Mill. \n",
      "Friday A much finer day than yesterday. This morning I sent the ducks to Mr Whiting, this is twenty that have been sent. We commenced making an office for Mr Mildred, it is to be made of wood, goodness knows what we shall be set to do next, I wish he would start the Mill again, but I suppose he won’t just yet, I expect we shall get the sack very soon; Kid got it last week. \n",
      "Saturday the 15th. I received a letter from Mr Schröder with the bank book. I did not get any money this evening. \n",
      "Sunday 16th Very windy; I went down to the boat to see if she was all right, just as I got down she break away and was going off. Nothing happened worth mentioning \n",
      "Wednesday 19th Mr Bowman came to know if I would go to work for him in the place of a man who was on the spree, I told him I would come, so in the afternoon Aunt and I went down to see if we could get a place for me to stop at, we went to Mrs Usher’s first, but she could not take me, but she would let me stop for a night or two till I could get a place; we then went to Mr Hudson’s and agreed to stop there.\n",
      "Middleton Thursday 20 Went on to work this morning, it seemed very strange at first, I was put to work k on the stones and kept there all day. Next week will be my nightwatch. \n",
      "Saturday 22nd got Castlen to come out at four, to let me go home by the truck. \n",
      "Monday 24th Went to the beach, to try if Nile would go in the water; he went in very well; I did not stop long, as I had to go on again at six. \n",
      "Saturday 29th Nothing worth putting down happened I was trying to shoot with a Rifle, I hit a pole once. I am very glad I have finished for this week. \n",
      "Monday 31st Started from the Goolwa to go to work; when I got nearly there I thought the Mill was on fire, but it turned out to be an old house on this side. It was noticed first about 12 o’clock Caslic woke Mr Bowman at two, but he only looked out and then went to bed again; it was close to the Mill, and if the wind had shifted I think it might have set the place on fire. \n",
      "Friday June 4 I have got along very well so far, I got paid to -day. Matthews gave me a large dog a sort of Kangaroo dog. \n",
      "Saturday 5 I have to work tonight till ten; Frank Robson was there a bit of the evening, he wanted to bet a pot about his weight with the stoker. \n",
      "Sunday 6th June I went to Chapel in the morning with Mr Hudson. Mr Taplin preached. In the afternoon I went to see Mr Whiting; he said Matthews should bring my money. I went with him all over the Mill. \n",
      "Monday 7th Went to work at one o’clock. I could not go to sleep in the day; went on again at six. I was taken very poorly in the morning, and have not been to work aga in this week on Thursday I came home. \n",
      "Friday the 11th Mr Bowman came up to see if I should be able to go to work Monday, I told him I thought I should. \n",
      "Saturday 12th It was a beautiful day, I had a walk round the jetties. \n",
      "Sunday June 13th Saw the stoker from Bowman’s, I told him to tell them I should be down by the first truck. Aunt and I went over to Mrs Nation’s in the morning. She gave us some turnips and onions, and told us a long yarn. We went to Chapel in the afternoon, Mr Roberts preached a very nice sermon. \n",
      "Monday the 14th I went up to Mr Good’s this morning, to buy a new coat. I got a Plaid one for 39/- I went down to the Mill by the first truck. They seemed glad to see me. \n",
      "Tuesday 15 It still keeps fine and we are very busy at the mill, working night and day, I was paid £3 9 10 I have not received any word from the Goolwa. \n",
      "Wednesday 16th There is nothing to put down as I am in the Mill all day. Ted Childs and I have been talking about going out shooting, when we shirt up; John Thring is going too. I think we intend taking a boat and going up the River. \n",
      "Thursday 17th I received a lot of soup and my things this morning, and a note from Aunt, I sent one to her Sam and Mr Green are gone to this spree at Spry’s. We are cleaning out the wheat bin, it is full of Weavel. \n",
      "Saturday the 19th In the afternoon Robert and Andrew went down to the beach, with the rifle, to see if they could hit a mark, they neither of them touched it. They were forced to give it up as it turned out very wet. I worked till ten, It was very fine when I went home. \n",
      "Sunday the 20 Mr Hudson lent me his mare to go home, It was rather wet, but I got on first rate; I went down to the boat, she was all right. I was going to catch some Pigeons for Mr Bowman, but Mr Gerard would not let me have the Key; he wouldn’t have the Mill opened on a Sunday, he was in a precious temper about something. I started form the Goolwa in the afternoon, and came home very quick. I don’t know how we are to get the boat without borrowing one to fetch it, as it is about a hundred yards from the bank. My wages last week come to £2 11 0 \n",
      "Monday I was at work from one o’clock; I went with Mr Hudson to Mr Suggs for some melons, I got on the sledge to have a ride but it hitched in the stumps so dreadfully, that I was glad to get off again, and had to walk as hard as I could split; it is about two miles from here, it was a beautiful day and we got home by one, I could not go to sleep in the afternoon so I went digging a bit in the garden. I was very tired before it was six. \n",
      "Tuesday 22 I felt very tired this morning, and did not sleep very well. It still keeps very fine, I hope it will be so Saturday. \n",
      "Wednesday the 23 I got on pretty well last night, it was very cold. In the morning, I got a letter from Aunt saying they were going to Kanmantoo on Sunday. They sent some jelly by the truck, and some cakes which were very nice, I got them when I went on at six. \n",
      "Saturday 26 I went to the Goolwa in the morning after I got my money £5 15 6 I found that they were going of in the to Kanmantoo. I told them to get a dog for me if they could, went down to the River to try my gun with balls, it did very well better than I expected. I was trying to catch some pigeons for Mr Bowman. I got two but I had a hard job, they are very wild. Mr Gerard went in the afternoon for the horse; I don’t know where he got him, at Simmonds’ I suppose. \n",
      "Sunday They went off a little after nine o’clock. It was a dull day; I started for Middleton directly after; I had a rare bundle to carry, and the Pigeons, which I left as I passed. In the afternoon, I was down to the beach, John Spry was there, making his dog go in the water, he went in first rate. Mr H. and I went to Chapel in the evening. \n",
      "Monday 28 I was stonedressing all day; Carlic was helping, we were loading flour in the morning. \n",
      "Wednesday 30 It is beautiful weather now; I wrote a long letter to Aunt yesterday, the Mill is going again all right. I heard just now that Mr Moony was killed by a bullock dray going over his head and neck, about four o’clock today; but I have not heard the particulars yet. \n",
      "Thursday July 1 It still keeps very fine; I think the inquest was held today, the verdict was accidental death; it appears he had been to the Nob, with a load of wood for Trip, and went from there to Dod’s, where he met a shipmate of his, and I suppose they made a few nobblers together, for some say he was tipsy; this man was going home with Moony to keep up the next day, as it would have been twenty years since they came into the Colony. Just after they started, this man was in the dray, Moony jumped up on the pole of the dray, when he got thrown off, and the wheel went over his head. \n",
      "Friday 2nd Moony was buried; there were a good many people there. I saw Mr Waddle today, for the first time since his illness he seemed pretty well. The weather keeps very dry, the farmers want wet now. I had a letter from Aunt yesterday, they had not got a dog. \n",
      "Saturday 3rd I worked till ten tonight, it is my night work next week. I hope Aunts will come home this next week, I earned £2 12 10. \n",
      "Sunday the 4th I lay in bed till nearly eight o’clock. Mr H. and I went to chapel. \n",
      "Monday 5th Mr H. lent me his horse to go to the Goolwa to fetch my gun, as I thought of going out Shooting but it was so late when I got back, that it was of no use the ride did me good I think. I went to work at one this morning. When I was at the Goolwa Mr G. and I had a chat. Kid was there too. Mr G. said Aunt wanted to come home this week, if he can get a horse I suppose he will fetch them. I hope they will come. \n",
      "Tuesday 6th I am getting on pretty well at the night work. I got a letter from Aunt today, to say they were coming home on Friday, they did not get any rabbits; I am glad of it, as they would have been a great deal of trouble. I have been out shooting but I did not get anything I only went a little way. \n",
