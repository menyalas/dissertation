It appears that the Governor sent this morning for Reynolds who declined to make the attempt to form a Ministry every one considers this a strange proceeding.

Seeing that they were a Majority of the House It was determined that I must b e the man without a dissentient voice – I could see Townsend was disappointed. He was obliged to put up with a vote that the Meeting approved of what he had done – Dined with the Dean meeting the Bishop and wife the Williams and Lady Charlotte Bacon.

He made a most lame case and the Atty. in a brilliant speech vindicated the Govt. Mr. Barr moved by way of helping the Govt. that the question should not be put. but I would no t accept the compromise. but insisted that it was due to the new Comr. that the motion should be negatived – My colleagues thought I had gone too far and in this view Baker and a host of others joined but I maintained the position.

This has probably been for me a more eventful Year than I am likely to witness again. Separated from my wife and family I have felt like one alone in the World and this loneliness has been the depressing from the want of my usual health.

The expressed opinions and pledges of the individuals could not be supported or redeemed by the Minist ry as a whole and there was then apparent division and weakness in the Camp. Reynold not only shewed that he was at issue with his Colleagues on most important points but he could not help shewing his illfeeling to Members willing generally to support th e Govt. and by insulting them even as an opposition that eventually brought him to grief – I certainly had no intention of supplanting Ayres. and yet circumstances principally caused by Ayres himself has led to my now on the 1st. of Jay 1866 to holding th e Office of Chief Secretary and but that I must leave before going into Recess I might reasonably expect to retain it many months at least,D0007,323,238,157,0.6596638655462185,0.08325,0.8721249999999999,0.044625,-0.21117500000000003,323,1.0

Papa and Mama were very delighted with some white wine and Papa made great fun coming home and declared he was obliged to hold mama in the buggy coming home. The wine certainly was very strong for Mamas cheeks were so red and her eyes so bright although she only had half a glass. Found one of my little quacks dead when we got home Oct 8 Sunday.

Dec 28 A public holiday We all take it very quietly and are all busing in making preparation for Stirling. I mend all my clothes and pack my dresses. I receive a letter from Kate to tell me Mrs Rankin had invited me to the Ferry and Mama to my astonishment seems almost inclined to let me go.
