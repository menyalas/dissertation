You will leave Cincinnati Wednesday and alone. Mother Regina will attend to your needs. Devotedly, Mother Josephine. This letter thrilled us both. I was delighted to make the sacrifice, and you were hiding your feelings that I might not lose any merit. Neither of us could find Trinidad on the map except in the island of Cuba.

The moral of the story was \"Indian Endurance.\" Dismissed them at two-thirty without one word of goodbye except the daily one.

Both gentlemen said they had traveled on the plains on the Santa Fe Trail, and they seemed to have made it a matter of conscience to inform me on the subject of cowboys. This in substance was their conversation with me: \"Sister, you may be snow-bound while on the plains.\" I looked my assent, I knew I could not stop the snow. \"Travelers are sometimes snow-bound for two weeks, and you are alone.

Why should snow or cowboys frighten me any more than others who will be traveling the same way! So you see, dearest, I'm not going to so long a distance as we thought. At three o'clock A M the baggage checker came through our coach. I looked to see how much the pocketbook contained just twenty-five cents. If I used it to ride to the Good Samaritan I'd be minus the fare to Mt St Vincent, so I made up my mind to skirt around from the Little Miami to the Good Samaritan Hospital.

He was good to this hospital. Last year he sent a barge of coal to us.\" I said he was good to anyone in need. He died possessed of three dollars and fifty cents.

There is an epidemic epizootic among the horses.\" I asked if Mr Segale's place of business was anywhere near. He pointed to Wood's Theater and I started to the place indicated. Brother Henry managed to find a \"hack\" to send me to Mt St Vincent.

My Darling Sister Justina: How interestedly you, Sister M Louis and myself read Eugénie de Guérin's Journal and her daily anxieties to save her brother from being a spiritual outcast! This Journal which I propose keeping for you will deal with incidents occurring on my journey to Trinidad and happenings in that far-off land to which I am consigned. The Journal will begin with the first act. Here is Mother Josephine's letter: Mt St Vincent, O, Nov 27, 1872. Sister Blandina, Steubenville, O My Dear Child: You are missioned to Trinidad. You will leave Cincinnati Wednesday and alone. Mother Regina will attend to your needs. Devotedly, Mother Josephine. This letter thrilled us both. I was delighted to make the sacrifice, and you were hiding your feelings that I might not lose any merit. Neither of us could find Trinidad on the map except in the island of Cuba. So we concluded that Cuba was my destination. I was to leave Steubenville quietly so that none of my obstreperous pupils might cause the incoming teacher       | S1019-D002 | 1 | 0.053 | 0.119 | 0.827 | 0.9425 | 15 | 0.06666667 |\n",
