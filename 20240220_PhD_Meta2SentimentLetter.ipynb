       "\t<tr><th scope=row>1</th><td> TRINIDAD On Train from Steubenville, Ohio, to Cincinnati. Nov 30, 1872. My Darling Sister Justina: How interestedly you, Sister M Louis and myself read Eugénie de Guérin's Journal and her daily anxieties to save her brother from being a spiritual outcast! This Journal which I propose keeping for you will deal with incidents occurring on my journey to Trinidad and happenings in that far-off land to which I am consigned. The Journal will begin with the first act. Here is Mother Josephine's letter: Mt St Vincent, O, Nov 27, 1872. Sister Blandina, Steubenville, O My Dear Child: You are missioned to Trinidad. You will leave Cincinnati Wednesday and alone. Mother Regina will attend to your needs. Devotedly, Mother Josephine. This letter thrilled us both. I was delighted to make the sacrifice, and you were hiding your feelings that I might not lose any merit. Neither of us could find Trinidad on the map except in the island of Cuba. So we concluded that Cuba was my destination. I was to leave Steubenville quietly so that none of my obstreperous pupils might cause the incoming teacher annoyance. Hence I went to Sunday catechetical class as usual 2:00 P M I was to take the 3:00 P M train for Cincinnati. I said to my hopefuls, \"Instead of catechism, I'm going to tell you an Indian story to-day.\" The schoolhouse roof was not disturbed, though the hurrahs were loud enough! The moral of the story was \"Indian Endurance.\" Dismissed them at two-thirty without one word of goodbye except the daily one. You remember how surprised I was to see a crowd at the station to wish me \"Godspeed\"; I thought I was to slip away without anyone's knowledge except our own. Mr Tait and Mr McCann wished to speak to me alone. Both had been in the West. \"You will have a long travel on the plains,\" they said, \"before you reach Trinidad.\" \"Where is Trinidad?\" \"A little mining town in Southwestern Colorado.\" So then I knew my destination, which, of course I would have been told at Mt St Vincent. Both gentlemen said they had traveled on the plains on the Santa Fe Trail, and they seemed to have made it a matter of conscience to inform me on the subject of cowboys. This in substance was their conversation with me: \"Sister, you may be snow-bound while on the plains.\" I looked my assent, I knew I could not stop the snow. \"Travelers are sometimes snow-bound for two weeks, and you are alone. This, though, is not the greatest danger to you.\" Mentally I was wishing both gentlemen somewhere else. \"Your real danger is from cowboys.\" I looked at the speakers. \"You do not seem to grasp our meaning. No virtuous woman is safe near a cowboy.\" Both gave up trying to make me understand what they considered danger. Why should snow or cowboys frighten me any more than others who will be traveling the same way! So you see, dearest, I'm not going to so long a distance as we thought. At three o'clock A M the baggage checker came through our coach. I looked to see how much the pocketbook contained just twenty-five cents. If I used it to ride to the Good Samaritan I'd be minus the fare to Mt St Vincent, so I made up my mind to skirt around from the Little Miami to the Good Samaritan Hospital. At four A M I rang the front doorbell no response. I sat on the stone steps and waited till I heard the rising bell, then I waited another fifteen minutes when again I rang the doorbell. Sister Anthony came. \"Why, child, where did you come from; how did you get here? I'm sure you are cold.\" I said I came from Steubenville. \"Oh, yes! dear Father Bigelow died there. He was good to this hospital. Last year he sent a barge of coal to us.\" I said he was good to anyone in need. He died possessed of three dollars and fifty cents. His hand was always open to any kind of distress. I did not mention to Sister Anthony that I walked from the Little Miami Station. After Mass, breakfast and miles of sympathy and \"God Bless You\" from the Sisters at the Good Samaritan, one of the nurses accompanied me to Fifth and Vine Streets, where I was to take \"Barney's Bus\" for Mt St Vincent. The bus was to leave at ten A M I waited till three P M then asked one of the clerks if he thought Mr McCabe would run the bus that day. \"I fear no bus will run to-day. There is an epidemic epizootic among the horses.\" I asked if Mr Segale's place of business was anywhere near. He pointed to Wood's Theater and I started to the place indicated. Brother Henry managed to find a \"hack\" to send me to Mt St Vincent. On the way, between the first ascent of the hill and the Seminary, I met Sisters Gabriella and Delphina walking in the slush and cold on their way to the Orphan Asylum. I stopped to take them in. They returned with me to Cedar Grove, from there the driver was to take them to the Asylum in Cumminsville. Sister Gabriella said to me, \"I would gladly go where you are going instead of shouldering this heavy burden.\" Sister is to be mother to three hundred orphans, taking Sister Sophia's place. The Sisters are showing great sympathy. I heard Sister Benedicta say, \"She does not mind going so far and alone I've not seen her shed a tear.\" Nor will you, my dear Sister. The tears will flow where none but He and myself will know. Still, I'm delighted to go. I did not tell you, dearest, that one year ago last November I wrote to Mother Regina saying I envied the sacrifices the Sisters were making who were sent far away to do God's work. I've received my answer with compound interest. You know that up to date the Sisters going on distant missions were consulted and none were sent who had parents living. I am pleased that that record is broken in my case. Mother Regina told me to spend a day at home. Dear Lord! Give me strength. I anticipate a scene. I spent Wednesday, December 5th, at our old homestead. Mother kept open house all day. Friends came in groups. Mr Leverone and bride, his mother and the bride's mother, Mrs Garibaldi, the Misses Gardelli and a host of others. Mrs Garibaldi threatened to take off my habit. I said, \"Hands off! Have you any right to detain Mary if John wishes to take her to California?\" \"Oh, that is different.\" \"Yes, as different as heaven and earth. I have chosen my portion, Mary has chosen hers, each abides by her choice.\" John Leverone's mother acted most sensibly all day. She was soothing oil to all the protests made to my going. Our dear mother kept quiet. When we were permitted a lone interview she asked, \"Do you want one of your sisters to accompany you?\" I answered, \"I prefer to do just as my superiors have told me.\" \"Well, then I will give you a thousand-dollar check so that in case you desire to return you will have the wherewith.\" \"No, no, dear mother, I fully realize the responsibilities I assumed. As you are aware, I realized them from the first day I entered the Novitiate.\" Mother replied: \"And I want to tell you I never doubted your vocation. I agree to your sacrifice, my dear child, keep on serving God, I will never interfere. Now that I have your explicit answer, friends cannot urge any logical reason to prevent your going.\" All day the visitors reminded me of a disturbed ant hill. When mother and I were alone she spoke the Genoese dialect. It was like hearing sketches of a favorite opera. Wednesday at 2:00 P M I went to visit our Ecclesiastical Superior. The Most Rev J B Purcell offered me several gifts. But St Francis Xavier is my patron, so I'm not going to possess any superfluous article, I only regret I could not pass our home without going in, as St Francis Xavier did. If I aim high I surely must reach some upper strata of detachment in His service. One thing I take with me, the impressive blessing given me by His Grace, part of which rings clear \"May angels guard your every step.\" He was extremely sympathetic at my having to go alone. I went to confession to Rev Dr Callaghan. You may recall how we enjoyed his lecture on the \"School Question\" delivered in Steubenville. After mother had a short interview with me, father managed to see me alone. He took hold of me and asked, \"Have I ever denied you anything?\" I signified no. \"You have never disobeyed me in your life?\" I assented. \"Now I command you you must not go on this far away mission! Are you going?\" \"Yes, father.\" He let go the hold on my arm and walked toward the door. Not without my seeing his tears falling fast. He did not realize his hold on my arm gave me pain not to speak of the heart-pain for him. In the railway station at St Louis between train time, I got off to purchase a pair of arctics. I saw several Italian women selling fruit. One of them had a daughter standing near. I asked the mother if she would permit her daughter to accompany me to the shoe store, which was in sight. The mother looked at me earnestly then said to her neighbor peddler, \"How do I know who she is, she looks like a monica (sister) but she might be a strega (witch).\" I thanked the true guardian of her daughter and went to make my purchase alone. I spoke English to the peddler. If good Sister Benedicta who thought I did not mind because I did not cry had seen me during the greater part of last night she would but too truly have said, \"That heart is human in every fiber.\" That I succeeded in dignifiedly getting away from home is Thy Grace, oh, my God! Forty-two persons accompanied me to the train, among them friends of old, but my purpose never faltered, not even in shadow. Such tactics as I executed yesterday! I see one trait strong in me, the straight service of God. Not the father whom I had never seen cry, nor the most patient, dearest mother whose heart is crushed at my being sent alone, much less the friends who used every argument to make me say I would not go could elicit the faintest trace that I was not more pleased at my going alone than if I had had a dozen with me. Sisters Antonia and Gonzaga came to the waiting room. I asked the company to permit me an interview with the Sisters. When going toward them, one of my dear old friends said, \"Look, we cannot doubt she is happy.\" This was not intended for my hearing, the noise caused the speaker to raise her voice. Sister Antonia asked me how I had spent the day. I narrated some incidents. \"I'm an ancient religious, but I could not have gone through the ordeal as creditably as you did.\" What if I had mentioned all the heart sighs I had witnessed! When it was time to board the train I asked that my last interview be with my mother. Cannot you picture her sad, endearing look of appreciation? I'll skip the last talk with mother some of it was in silence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td><td>S1019-D002</td><td>0.051</td><td>0.131</td><td>0.818</td><td> 0.9994</td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><th scope=row>2</th><td> Kansas City, Dec 6, 1872. Number one! Number two! Number three! I went toward omnibus number three. \"Any convent in this city?\" I asked. \"Yes, ma'am, step in.\" When the bus drove on the convent avenue, I saw the whole place was lighted up. I rang the doorbell and it was answered instantly. I said to the Sisters, \"Did you expect me?\" \"No, Sister.\" \"How, then, did you respond so quickly?\" \"We expected a Sister on this train. We are staying up with a dead Sister who will be buried tomorrow. In your case it is fortunate the Sister did not come you can occupy the room prepared for her the only spare room in the convent.\" Previous to this explanation, I had quickly reasoned: Superiors at home watched the papers saw the railroad accident wired the convent the result being the illumination and Sisters waiting. It did not occur to me that there might be more than one convent in Kansas City. The next turn of affairs brought me to the reality of my position. The two Sisters who had opened the door went to report the non-appearance of the one expected and my coming. Presently the Sisters returned, but their countenances had a dejected look. I became apprehensive at once and asked: \"What is it, Sisters?\" \"Our Superior wants to know if it is customary for your Sisters to travel alone?\" said one. \"No, Sister, it is not.\" \"Have you your letter of obedience?\" \"I destroyed it before starting on this journey. I have no credentials to show except the name on my wearing apparel.\" \"Why are you traveling alone?\" \"Because I was sent alone.\" With this explanation they left me to make a second report. When they returned they were more dejected than before. The elder of the two Sisters spoke: \"Sister, our Superior thinks you had better go to some hotel.\" \"Sisters, I have been well provided for my journey, but I cannot set people thinking by leaving the hospitality of a convent to seek shelter in some hotel. I clearly see I'm considered some sort of a fake, however, if you will kindly let me rest on that sofa, you can allay your fears by locking the door and taking the key with you.\" They went to make a third report. When they returned it was a pleasure to see their cheerful faces. One spoke, \"No, Sister, we are going to prepare a lunch for you.\" \"Please do not. This is the First Friday of the month and a Holy Communion day for me.\" The last vestige of doubt and fear disappeared from their countenances. A pillow and comfort were placed on the sofa and bidding me good rest, they locked the door, taking the key with them. At six o'clock A M, I was shown to the chapel. After Mass I noticed some hesistancy as how to proceed with me. Would they leave me in the convent, or have me join in the funeral procession to their graveyard? Presently I felt a light thump at the left of the priedieu on which I knelt. I looked and saw a hand holding a candle for me to take I understood I was to fall in line. After the funeral, breakfast was served me in the same room in which I had rested. About ten o'clock A M, the Superior came to interview me. I saw the handwriting on the wall, I was an impostress. Had time from interview until three o'clock to myself. During this interval I wrote. Among the jottings I wrote a letter to dear Sister Gabriella, telling her I was in a religious convent at Kansas City, but was considered some one in disguise. I told her I was glad it was I instead of Sister Justina, because her sensitiveness would make her suffer intensely. I am taking the whole incident as some of the many things that may happen to me on my journey to the Southwest. At three o'clock P M, I asked for a companion to accompany me to order the omnibus for the midnight train. After placing my order, I turned to the clerk and said, \"Be sure to send the bus.\" When I reached the exit door I returned to where the clerk was standing, and said, \"It is absolutely necessary for me to take the outgoing midnight train. Under no consideration neglect to have the omnibus come for me.\" He assured me again the order was properly placed and would be attended to. The train that brought me from St Louis had been delayed two hours, owing to the accident which had occured to the train ahead of ours. There is only one daily (nightly) train from this place to the terminus of the road. Dinner and supper were served me as breakfast had been. I am hoping that some of the Sisters will come in to relieve my mind and tell me what speices of a scarecrow I am thought to be. It is seven o'clock no one has come in so far some one now. \"You poor child! What must you think of us and the spirit of this convent?\" I did not have time to answer, for a voice called, \"Sister Martha!\" Sister Martha grasped her lighted candle and briskly followed the voice. I mentally observed that we would not carry a lighted candle through corridors and rooms. However, I have enough to think about without letting fire insurance policies annoy me. The room is dark, a reflection from a lamp-post in the street throws a small stream of light in one window. I still have fully four hours before the bus calls for me. \"Angels guard your every step.\" I'm going to rest on the sofa. I heard a voice, \"Sister?\" I sat erect. \"Mother wants to know if you are sure you ordered the bus?\" Was it my want of rest or injured feeling of pride which was on the verge of giving vent to my thoughts? From the gleam of light that came from the lamp-post I noticed that the speaker was a novice. \"Surely, Sister Blandina, you will not scandalize an aspirant in His service!\" While silently speaking thus to myself I looked at the young novice. She had a good placid face, and I said, \"Sister, please say to your Superior that I surely ordered the bus.\" She bowed and left me. Now, dearest Sister Justina, if by some unthinkable reason the omnibus does not come for me, I am positively certain the police will! \"Angels guard your every step.\" How happy I am that you, dear, are not in this predicament. I am arranging my speech to the policeman. I hear him say, \"The nuns sent for me to show you the way to any hotel you wish to go to!\" and I shall say, \"I do not wish to go to any hotel. Be kind enough to wire to the Most Rev J B Purcell, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for any information you desire about me.\" I see a note of intelligence appear on his countenance while he critically studies me but through it all I cannot see myself going to any hotel. Though the suspense of not knowing what may happen makes me uneasy. Twenty minutes after eleven I hear the patter of horses' hoofs on the convent avenue. Deo Gratias. When I realized the omnibus had come for me, I put on my wraps and with my traveling black basket walked toward the door. It was opened by a Sister in the hall. Then it was I noticed this Sister had performed the work of a sentinel, guarding me! My impulse was to brush by her and into the bus. But telepathy worked quicker than impulse. Right reason was on their side. Instant remembrance recalled the fact that a few months previous I was given charge of two dressed as Franciscan Sisters and who were making a collection in Steubenville. I was to attend to them and they were not to associate with the Sisters. The day which was to be their last with us, and when they were on their way to the station to leave the town, a policeman tapped one of the two and said, \"Both of you come with me.\" The guardian of the law had seen a big foot encased in a boot. One was a man, the other his wife, who personified Franciscan Sisters. So instead of acting by impulse, I said: \"Please, Sister, say a fervent prayer that I may reach my destination in safety.\" I saw a glistening tear of sympathy. Was I not reaping reward for suppressing a hasty impulse? Nothing noticeable took place from the time the train left Kansas City until we reached the terminus of the railroad. A few scattered frame houses and the place is called Coolage. (I am spelling this name phonetically). A train was being made up of constructive material and at the end of the train I saw a very shabby coach from the windows of which a number of men were craning their necks looking at me. Gazing in every direction, I finally saw the train conductor. I went toward him and asked if I might board the made-up train for Kit Carson. He said: \"To-morrow we will put on a day coach; this is only a construction train carrying construction material and a crowd of Irish workmen to Kit Carson.\" \"Any objection to my going with them?\" \"Not if you can put up with a working man's ‘smoker.’\" I went toward the train. The conductor assisted me into the coach. The instant the Irishmen saw a Sister their hats came off and pipes were taken out of their mouths. When seated, I said to the two men in front of me: \"Please say to these good men that I am very fond of smoke from a pipe.\" The men replaced their hats and resumed their smoking. I doubt which side was more pleased they, to have me, or I to be with them. We reached Kit Carson shortly after midnight. When \"End of Construction line\" was called, one of the men stepped over to me and offered to carry my basket. I handed it to him; then, a gentleman bowed and gave me a letter. The one who had my basket waited to see what would happen. I read the letter and saw by its contents I was to follow the giver of the letter. Thanking the courtesy of the first man I let myself be guided by the second. This was Mr Mullen, an agent of Otero and Seller, the greatest commission firm of the Southwest. The loaded caravans of this firm are constantly on the Santa Fe Trail. My instructions from Mother Regina are: \"Wait in Kit Carson until the Sisters from Trinidad come for you.\" The letter handed me is from Sister Marcella, in charge of the Trinidad School Mission. It says, \"Take the stage and come on to Trinidad.\" Kit Carson, Colorado, Dec 8, 1872 This is the feast of the Immaculate Conception, and the anniversary of making our vows. I wonder what you are doing, dear Sister Justina, while I am trying to solve the problem of either going or staying here to-day. The facts are these: Had I not been compelled to wait over twenty-two hours in Kansas City, I should have arrived here in time to take the stage that would have brought me into Trinidad on the morning of the Feast of the Immaculata. Mother Regina's instruction ceases with the new order. Only exceptionally do we travel on Sundays and feast days of obligation, so I will order the stage for to-morrow and begin a little catechetical missionary work to-day. No better feast could inaugurate my new life. When I said Grace before breakfast, I noticed how gravely the junior Mullen looked at me; which gives me the best guarantee he hasn't been taught his prayers. I asked Mrs Mullen if she had any objection to my taking James on the plains to watch the habits of the prairie dogs. She said, \"I am glad to have him go, but prairie dogs have queer habits, they cannot be caught unless they are cornered in a place where they have no burrows.\" So Jamie and myself started to watch the prairie dogs. The little midgets remained on their artificial mounds until we got quite near them, then barked their peculiar baby bark, when, with a still more singular wheezy bark, turned and bounded into their subterranean houses. Shall we ever learn the language of the lower animals! It was very plain we could not catch any of the little creatures, so I turned my attention to my young companion. \"Can you bless yourself?\" \"Like you did at breakfast?\" \"Exactly.\" \"Daddy said I ought to know how to do what you did.\" \"Shall I teach you?\" \"Oh! good, I will surprise daddy!\" I began with the Sign of the Cross. He learned quickly. I repeated the first part of the Lord's Prayer by periods many times. Then played catcher and tried again to run down a prairie dog. The little fellow was more anxious to learn than to play; which pleased me very much. By the time we went in to dinner, he had passably memorized the Lord's Prayer, Hail Mary and Grace before and after meals, so at dinner he silently said Grace with me. Mrs Mullen told me that three ladies had called to see me and would return this afternoon. We had buffalo meat for dinner. While on the train from Coolage (Colidge) to Kit Carson we saw a herd of buffalo. The herd was on a stampede. The brutes did look crazy; plainly, whatever direction they made for, nothing could stop them. Someone on the train remarked that it was surprising to see a herd of buffalo, as Kit Carson and Dick Wooten (both frontier trappers) had declared there were no more buffalo in herds. One might see a small group here and there on the plains, but a herd of buffalo was out of the question. Yet we saw one. The three ladies called again. They were anxious to be sympathetic at my traveling alone and so young! But they soon convinced themselves I needed no sympathy in my prospective workThe stage will call for me in the morning. I was told I am the only passenger booked for to-morrow. Mrs Mullen is having clean hay ready to put in the coach. I expected there would be others in the stagecoach with me. \"Angels guard your footsteps.\" </td><td>S1019-D004</td><td>0.055</td><td>0.111</td><td>0.834</td><td> 0.9993</td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><th scope=row>3</th><td> Trinidad, December 10, 1872. My dearest dear: Here I am safe in Trinidad, Colorado Territory, instead of in the island of Cuba where we first thought I was to go. No wonder this small pebble (Trinidad, Colo) is not on our maps. \"Angels guide your footsteps.\" This sentence has stayed with me from the time I left the Archbishop's residence in Cincinnati, and is with me still. In Kit Carson I ordered the stage for the morning of the 9th Mrs Mullen was very attentive. She had new clean hay put in the stage to keep my feet warm, and after I got in she wrapped a large comfort around me, remarking that \"traveling on the plains and in winter was not a pleasant prospect.\" The driver must have had strict injunctions from Otero and Seller they own the stage line. For the first time I had indefinable fears. The cowboys were constantly in my mind. I expected there would be a number traveling with me on the plains. \"Snow-bound and cowboys\" came in thought to annoy me. At noon the driver came to the stage door and said: \"We take dinner here.\" I thanked him and said: \"I do not wish any dinner.\" \"But, lady, we will not have another stopping place to eat until six o'clock this evening.\" I thanked him again, \"but I do not wish any dinner.\" The jolting of the stage and my thoughts had taken all appetite away. Though I could see nothing from the stage, (every flap was fastened) it seemed that the driver aimed to drive over every stone and make the wheels go into every rut. It was nothing but a jerk up and down all the way in a stage that had no springs and traveling at the rate of twelve miles an hour! At six o'clock we arrived at the station for supper. At every station the mules were changed. The driver came to ask me to supper. I thanked him, but said: \"I do not wish any supper.\" \"There will not be another chance for a meal until twelve o'clock to-night, and you have not tasted anything to-day, so come now and take it if only a cup of black coffee.\" \"No, thank you, I have no desire for anything.\" The poor man was quite distressed. He could not think I was trying to save traveling expenses, because the price of stage traveling included meals. Here is the mental attitude I was in: If the driver could surmise the vague fear that is preying on me he would know I have no appetite. He went in to supper and presently returned. \"Lady, if you do not want to eat come in and let me have my supper. The woman who runs this station will not give me a drink of muddy water unless I fetch you in to supper I told her how you are dressed and she goes off wild and says: ‘Bring her in or you will get nothing to eat to-night, nor any other time you come.’\" I went into an adobe, log-raftered, mud-floored, mud-plastered hut. The sight of the red checkered table cloth and black coffee only added to my repugnance for food. The person who kept the station was an Irish woman of the good old stamp. I made an effort to sip some coffee, but not a drop would pass my lips. The cowboys were in my mind. I tried to ascertain if there were any in the vicinity, the answers I received were indefinite. At midnight: \"Now, lady, you will have a good meal.\" \"No, thank you, I desire nothing.\" \"What will Otero and Seller say to me when they find out you did not take a meal during this journey? They gave me more orders about you than I ever got since I'm staging, and that's ten years.\" \"Say I wished for nothing. I will write the firm my thanks.\" Oh, the lonely, fearful feeling! The night was dark. No passengers to allay my turbulent thoughts. Foot-steps drew near the stage. My heart was thumping. The driver opened the stage door and said: \"You will have a traveling companion for some miles.\" In the open door, by the light of the lantern, I saw a tall, lanky, hoosier-like man, wearing a broad brimmed hat. On one arm he had a buffalo robe. While I sat riveted, he got in asked me if I would take part of his \"kivver,\" and before my fright permitted me to speak, he placed part of the buffalo robe over the comfort that enwrapped me, and sat beside me on the rear seat. The driver closed the door and we were in utter darkness. By descriptions I had read I knew he was a cowboy! With crushing vividness \"No virtuous woman is safe near a cowboy\" came to me. I made an act of contrition concentrated my thoughts on the presence of God thought of the Archbishop's blessing, \"Angels guard your steps,\" and moved to such position as would put my heart in range with his revolver. I expected he would speak I answer he fire. The agony endured cannot be written. The silence and suspense unimaginable. Suddenly from out the darkness I heard: \"Madam!\" \"Sir!\" \"What kind of a lady be you?\" \"A Sister of Charity.\" \"Whose sister?\" \"Everyone's Sister, a person who gives her life to do good to others.\" \"Quaker like, I reckon?\" \"No, not quite.\" By this time I learned from his tone of voice that I had nothing to fear. He asked me a number of questions, all prompted by a conversation he had had with the driver before he came into the stage. In my turn I asked him why he became a cowboy. He said he had read of cowboys and ran away from home to become one. \"Is your mother still living?\" \"Yes, I allow she is leastwise she was when I left home six years ago. \"Have you written to her?\" \"No, madam, and I allow that's beastly.\" \"It is certainly unkind to one whom you can always trust and who, I am sure, loves you as much now as she did when you were a little fellow.\" His voice got husky. \"What do you say I otter do?\" \"Write; do so as soon as you get off this stage. Tell her you will soon make her a visit, and see to it that you keep your word.\" \"I will, so help me God! I was mighty feared to speak to you when I got in, because the mule driver said you was more particular than any lady he ever seen. I allow I am powerful glad I spoke to you.\" To think that this lubberly, good-natured cowboy had made me undergo such mortal anguish. He got off on the outskirts of Trinidad where the driver stopped to point out to me dugouts at the side of the foothills. \"This, lady, is Trinidad.\" A fainting feeling came over me as I looked at what I would have thought were kennels for dogs. Then I remembered my perfect health, the many years in the order of nature, before my call would come. While these thoughts were dominating, bright and vivid came to my vision the life of St Francis Xavier, farther away, in a more desolate country, with less companions, and yet who did more for God? Though I know the driver continued to talk, I do not recall a word he said. There on the outskirts facing the dugouts of Trinidad I took St Francis Xavier as my model in the missionary life. The stage stopped to throw off the mail. While so doing, a gentleman, wearing a Roman collar and having a clerical look, came to the stage door and said: \"Ya, ya, Sister, come out. This is the Convent,\" pointing to a store, which, at a glance I could see was being used for post-office and general store. He made a motion to help me out. I put my hands in my habit sleeves and sat upright in the stage, acknowledging his proffered courtesy by \"Thank you, I'll stay here.\" The gentleman's eyes twinkled merrily and he walked briskly away. A few minutes after the driver came out, took the reins and drove off. Another stopping place. The driver opened the door and said: \"Here we are.\" Before making any attempt to leave the stage, I looked at the house and in the recess of the door saw two of our Sisters. I thought, this is more like it, and was helped in by Sisters Marcella and Fidelis. The gentleman who had come to the stage door is the parish priest who wanted to see as he expressed it \"what kind of a Sister is she who was sent across the plains alone.\" He wanted to give an agreeable surprise by playing a joke. Before the stage reached the convent, he managed to say to the Sisters: \"You cannot play jokes on her.\" To-day is Mother Regina's birthday, and my first day West. I will continue this journal and some years hence send it to you, dear Sister Justina. I'm not to go in school until the 6th of January, 1873. I began to review my Spanish. Rev P J Munnecum, the parish priest, is the teacher. To my surprise, the Sisters do not speak Spanish. My previous study of the language is a great help to me and has created a desire in the Sisters to study the language also. December 14, 1872 I am sure, dearest Sister Justina, you will be interested in my viewpoint of things as I find them here. To-day I went to look at my schoolroom to be; 40 ft long; 14 ft wide; 8 ft high; two small windows, lowsized door, no transom; solid adobe walls on two sides, log rafters as black as ebony. Of necessity ventilation said \"Goodbye\" when the house was completed. But I must add all these adobe houses were built with a view to protect the inhabitants in case of a sudden attack from the warring Indians. That does not mean that every house has these dimensions. The head of each family built to suit his taste in the matter of length, breadth, and height but material to date is unchangeable: sunburnt mud (shaped, of course) 4×9×18 inches; the foundation the same as walls, mud roof over rafters mud floors. There are some seventyfive of these houses on \"Mexican Hill.\" That will be my first objective point; the second will be the jail. The Purgatoire River corrupted into Picatwar, but the natives kept its correct name, Purgatorio is below the acequia, (artificial canal) which is the boundary line to land and house given by Mr Filippe Baca, one of the leading citizens here, to the Sisters for a school. The land on which the Academy is built (now in course of erection) was donated by a Mr Heone, who lives a few miles outside of Trinidad. This gentleman and Dr Beshoar, our physician, have pews in the church if you can call eight planks nailed together, pews. The Sisters use the choir loft. The church is an adobe structure with a pretense of a gable roof and a double pretense of having been shingled; mud floor, mud walls, wooden candlesticks. Previous to the Sisters coming, bottles were used for candlesticks. The only restful spot about the church are the grounds to the entrance of it. The graveyard is in the rear of the church with a street between graveyard and convent. There is a long stretch of an adobe wall from convent (academy) to public school, the only one here and taught by the Sisters. I am told there is an Academy (called \"Rice\") maintained by the Methodists. We have twelve resident young ladies at the Academy, occupying the part that is built; very few in the select school. The Sisters are: Sister Marcella, in charge and music teacher; Sister Martha, Housekeeper; Sister Eulalia, Factotum; Sister Fidelis, Select School; Sister Blandina, Public School Teacher; Sister Eulalia, Assistant. Here is the Trinidad of today: Commercial Street, a few scattered houses the length of two blocks. Main Street, a few scattered stores occupying one side of the street about the same length as Commercial Street. Convent Street, we use to the end of the Public School grounds, where there are a few small adobe huts. So far, Mr Baca has the only house that looks like a residence. Then there is the Mexican settlement on the hill. I am informed that very few prisoners ever come to trial. They manage to burrow out from jail before the Circuit Court convenes. The Circuit Court comes from Denver. Here, if you have a largeness of vision, you find the opportunity to exercise it; if a cramped one, the immense expanse of the plains, the solid Rockies, the purity of the atmosphere, the faultlessness of the canopy above, will stretch the mind toward the Good. Maybe, dearest, it may please you to know my own attitude at the present writing. Vede mio cuore. (Look at my heart). I wish I had many hands and feet, and a world full of hearts to place at the service of the Eternal. So much one sees to be done, and so few to do it. I have adopted this plan: Do whatever presents itself, and never omit anything because of hardship or repugnance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td><td>S1019-D005</td><td>0.056</td><td>0.101</td><td>0.843</td><td> 0.9987</td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><th scope=row>4</th><td> December 21. Rumor is loud in predicting an attack from the Ute tribe. We have a girl at the Academy named Ida Chené, whose mother gave me a vivid account of a sudden attack from one of the roving wild Indian tribes. The purpose of the attack was to drive out all who were not Mexicans this tribe had allied itself with the Mexicans. The outbreak took place near Taos. Mrs Chené was in the field plowing when the macheté was raised over her head and she was asked to pronounce the word juangoche. She did so to the satisfaction of the attacking group, who galloped away either to cleave or scalp the next who could not pronounce the word correctly. It is singular that not any of these things can cause me to fear. We have our own chapel. Very few Catholic Americans in Trinidad. The Church on Sunday is crowded by our native population, who come from many directions. Vehicles of every description bring the devout. Not a native woman wears any other covering on head except a mantella or shawl, and they kneel on the bare floor, and, let me add, they know how to pray and do it. In our well-to-do churches East, to secure musical harmony, professors and trained singers are engaged; in the congregations of mediocre wealth, the best talent give their service, attend rehearsals and sing when required. Yet in both elements there is a constant friction, if not always expressed, a felt dissatisfaction, and it is frequently a subject of annoyance to the Catholic conscience as to whether or not the duty of assisting at Mass is complied with by the choir attendants. The congregation, from youth to age, is ever ready to criticise the director, organist, individual singers, and choir. In the combined action of choir and congregation, how much intrinsic honor is rendered to God! He, alone, is the Judge. Now bring your attention to a close view of a scene in this church. The performers are two greyhaired men, each holding a large violin. The instrument reclines against the left knee, which is in position to rise when the signal is given that Mass has begun; right knee bent to the ground, eyes closed and head inclined. The priest begins, Et introibo, etc The violin players, with voice and instrument, strike off a half-singing, half reciting Kyrie, etc The violins seldom strung to the same pitch. On great feast-days one, sometimes two, guitars are added, no two instruments tuned in unison, but who can doubt that every heart beats in harmony with that of the celebrant. A short time after the Sisters' arrival (1870), at the request of the priest and the English speaking portion of the congregation, the music teacher took charge of choir and began gradually to train pupils to sing in church services, the congregation contenting itself by chiming in when one of its old-time hymns was sung. Even that died out, leaving Dona Juanita Simpson to lead a chorus when Los Americanos are not in the church. Preparations are being made for a Christmas Tree. It is to be in the select schoolroom. I notice that two of our Italian musicians are active in seeing that the tree is well loaded, and I further remark that only the resident pupils and Sisters will share from the tree. I'm only glancing over occurrences. By another year I shall have things clear in my mind. Some of our Eastern showmen, say Barnum of New York, or Robinson of Cincinnati, could make an addition to their curios if they so desired. Witness this feat in our unprovided gymnasium. After this, never I say \"crazy as a bd bg .\" We go to the table, seat ourselves as comfortably as the long benches will permit, begin a nice chat on the rare atmosphere, white clouds and ether blue; in lieu of having changed yesterday's menu from bread, meat and water to water, meat and bread. While our spirits clash with our wits, a number of knowing odoriferous acrobats let themselves drop from the rafter on to our midday spread. Their knowledge in mind reading is great everything is left for them to eat!!! To exclude these celebrated chinchi, we are going to change our dining room. Menu will be on the same lines. But our chef thinks we may soon expect a change. January 10, 1873 I know, dear Sister Justina, you would undoubtedly be very much pleased had you my pupils. You would have abundance of material for evolution. I have always given you credit for evolving the best from any character, not only morally, but intellectually as well. I doubt if the ages of my pupils would be as satisfactory to you, the majority are older than myself, and some tower fifteen inches above my head. To-day my capacity for controlling them was put to the test. You know I'm a companion outside of the schoolroom, and a teacher the instant the threshold of the schoolroom is crossed. Felipe Gurulé, son of a wealthy Mexican and a natural leader, said to the older pupils this morning: \"Oiga muchachos listen, boys, at the 10 o'clock recess when Sister calls class, do not file in, just to see what the little lady will do.\" He spoke in Spanish and thought I did not understand him. Previous to ringing the recess bell, I called the young man and told him to remain in the room, as I wished to speak to him. When the room was vacated, I asked him to throw windows and doors open for ventilation. Having done so, he took his seat, waiting to hear what I had to say. I went to my desk, scribbled a few notes, then rang the bell for second school session; the pupils, not having a leader \"Just to see what the little lady will do\" filed in as usual. There was suppressed mirth, but nothing obstreperous. When the pupils were seated, I called Felipé and asked if he would not like a few moments' airing. He smiled and went out. At the noon dismissal, he returned and asked, \"Sister, did you understand what I said to the boys this morning?\" I answered that I did. \"Then you speak Spanish?\" \"You may judge when a chance offers,\" I replied. The afternoon session was a revelation to me, every-one was so attentive and so pleased. I wonder what the next attempt on the teacher will be for boys will be boys all the world over. A worried mother came to me to-day. \"Sister, I have three boys men, all of them. I heard them say they want to come to your school. I'm afraid to let ‘Dwarf’ come. John and Jeff are all right, but ‘Dwarf’ fights worse than a bulldog when you try to take meat from it.\" \"Send them and do not worry,\" I told her. John and Jeff came to school. No teacher could desire better behaved pupils, nor any more anxious to learn. The worried mother was afraid to let \"Dwarf\" come. John spoke to me of \"Dwarf\" and said, \"If he comes it will take my mind off my studies, because I will have to watch that he does not get into a fight or break some of the school rules. Yet I wish he would come. I never heard him express a wish to be with any teacher before.\" \"Bring him, John, and before he comes mention the few rules. ‘No tobacco to be used in or around the school premises; no vulgarity in word or action.’ These two rules ought not to deter anyone anxious to study from coming to school.\" \"Dwarf\" came. John watched him as closely as an eagle does its prey. Two weeks have passed since \"Dwarf\" made his appearance. Behavior good. February 5 This day will be memorable for the pupils of Public School No 1. Jefferson came to my desk at recess time; he wanted to speak to me. \"Well, Jefferson, what do you wish to say?\" I asked. \"Sister, I want to study your religion.\" \"There are a number of things you would have to do which might not be to your liking,\" I remarked. \"Name one of the things, Sister.\" \"Confession.\" \"That means to tell everything wrong I do?\" \"It means that, with a plus and plus.\" \"What is the first plus?\" \"To be sorry you did wrong.\" \"And the second?\" \"To resolve not to do that wrong again.\" \"Dwarf,\" standing at the schoolroom door, looked at us both, his eyes flashing anger. He came toward Jefferson, raised his fist and hit him on his left jaw. I felt certain the jaw was broken. Jefferson looked at me, my eyes said, \"Keep still.\" \"Dwarf\" expected Jefferson to jump at him, and stood at defense. I broke the silence by addressing Jefferson, and said \"I'll put arnica on your face, Jefferson, and meanwhile, take your seat.\" A number of pupils anticipating trouble quietly gathered near the schoolroom door to witness the scene which they expected to take place. Every instant was a psychological one. The pupils intent in protecting the teacher against an infuriated human being who stood with blazing eyes and ready arms, waiting an onslaught on him from somewhere, but ready to annihilate anyone who would dare touch him. Jefferson went to his seat. I looked at the clock and said, \"Recess time is up,\" and rang the bell. \"Dwarf\" was nonplussed. He looked dejected; followed me to the door, took his place in the ranks and came in with his classmates, went to his seat and stared at me with wondering eyes. After attending to Jefferson, I took my seat at the desk and motioned to \"Dwarf\" to come to me. He came instantly and blurted out: \"Jeff told you I was chewing tobacco, didn't he?\" \"No, you were not mentioned. Jefferson was pleading with me to let him study my religion.\" \"Dwarf\" stood amazed. The bulldog had become a lamb. I continued in low tones: \"Suppose you were speaking to me of something of interest to you, and Jefferson entered the room and hit you in the jaw with all his strength, what ought I to do to Jefferson?\" \"Give him a sound thrashing to make him remember he made a fool of himself,\" he replied. \"I like your sense of justice,\" I remarked. \"Shall I get a switch?\" he asked. While he went out for something to have himself chastised, his brother John came to my desk. \"Sister, I'm afraid ‘Dwarf’ will do something unexpected, but I'll be at your side in one bounce.\" \"Thank you, but take your seat.\" \"Dwarf\" came in with a strong branch of cotton-wood tree. Without one word from me he gave me his right hand, then his left. Did he feel what I felt? I do not know. I hoped he would remain after morning session to have a little talk with me, but he did not, nor did he return this afternoon, from which I infer his school days are over, as far as this school is concerned. I intend to follow him up at his home and help his mother as best I can to make a better boy of him. Was this not using psychic knowledge to some purpose? February 19 This noon a number of the young men pupils came slowly into the school hall. The look on their faces puzzled me, so I walked to the front door. I ought to tell you, the road from the Convent to the end of the Public School building, one block, is used as a play-ground for the boys; the girls use the ground at the rear of the school. The look of the pupils made me fear some mischief was on hand. As soon as I reached the door facing the street, a man holding a child by each hand came toward me. \"Sister, I want to tell you, your pupils are not kind to my boys. I brought them here to play, and your pupils walked away.\" I felt sorry for the two poor innocent lads, so only said, \"Put at least a small shirt on each of them and bring them at playtime.\" The man's eyes and mouth opened wide, then he said, \"Ah, I see, I will put a camisa on them.\" February 23 Organized a Vigilant Club among the most earnest pupils. The object of this club is to report to me any case of distress in families or individuals. We are to have fun, too, but all leading to self-improvement. Clubs must have some object. This club is to meet conditions as we find them here, and improve them when possible. Oh, the immense field of work there is in this place! I've not mentioned the location of Trinidad and its consequent results. It is the rendezvous for the outlawed, who take to the Santa Fé Trail, and an equal protector for those who use the \"Statute of Limitation\" from the Territory of New Mexico. The boundary line between Colorado and New Mexico is just twelve miles from Trinidad. The spot is marked by a large stone, a few rods from which is the toll gate kept by Mr Dick Wooten, one of the first trappers of these regions. Mr Wooten's home is a refuge for all sorts of characters who can hold themselves in check while under his roof.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>S1019-D006</td><td>0.061</td><td>0.099</td><td>0.840</td><td> 0.9981</td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><th scope=row>5</th><td> March 1, 1873. My Dear Sister Justina: It is some time since I jotted down anything in my journal. The fact is, so many incidents followed one another that it is difficult for me to note even the ones most out of the ordinary. To-day Sister Marcella and myself were at choir rehearsal when one of our native boys came in to say quite enthusiastically for a Mexican: \"Hay muchas hermanas y gentes.\" (There are many Sisters and people). And he added in English: \"And Bishop Salpointe, and priests, and mules, and wagons, all in the corral!\" This from the speaker who was anxious to have courtesy shown the travelers. Let me remark that every Spaniard or Mexican I've met has an innate refinement. Sister Marcella sent me to see to the travelers for, so we surmised, they were. When I got to the corral, I saw a medley crowd sure enough of holy men and women, and a very unholy sight of wagons, mules, and shabbily appareled, dusty and tired travelers. I took in the situation at a glance. Among the groups waiting some recognition I noticed a number of Sisters toward whom I made my way, and only succeeded in saying, \"You are welcome, Sisters,\" when one of them fairly lifted me off my feet. When she let me down, I raised my eyes to look at her she is quite tall wondering if I knew her. At first glance my wonder ceased. It was Sister Martha from the convent of my Kansas City adventure! The travelers remained with us five days. They were on their way to Arizona. Our Sisters here are, as elsewhere, most hospitable. What time I could give from my school work, I gave to our visitors. Three of these Sisters were at the Kansas City Convent, where, it will be recalled, by an accident to the train ahead of us, I had been obliged to stop off, and I had gone to their convent to await the arrival of the next train. From these Sisters I learned why I was suspected of being an impostor. A few weeks before my arrival, two men had made a wager. One man asserted that he could gain admittance to the convent after closing hour, the other positively denying that he could do so. The former, to prove his assertion, dressed in woman's clothes, applied to the convent for a night's lodging, \"I have no money, I am hungry, please give me something to eat and shelter for the night.\" The pseudo-woman was served supper, at which time the preconcerted signal was given in proof that he had gained entrance. He gave a shrill whistle and rushed from the Convent. The Sisters hardly had had time to get over their fright when I made my appearance. This accounts for the many questions put to me. Yet the unique part of the whole proceeding was that every question I answered was my own condemnation. \"Do your Sisters travel alone?\" \"No, Sister.\" \"Why are you alone?\" \"Because I was sent alone.\" \"Your letter of Obedience?\" \"I destroyed it before starting on this journey.\" Under these conditions, who would not have been suspicious of me, and who would not have taken the precaution to watch my every act? Sister Martha then told me that, with all appearances against me, the Sisters had been sympathetic. They had felt an uneasiness of mind during all the hours I was compelled to wait for the outgoing train. Good Friday, 1873. Sisters Marcella, Fidelis, and myself went to the Sierra one of the Rocky Mountain spurs to see the Penitentes make the \"Way to Calvary.\" About one hundred took part in it. They walked in twos, faces covered, backs bared. Each had several branches of long bruised cacti, with which they lashed their backs as they slowly ascended the spur. At each lash they said, \"Yo penitente pecador,\" (I, a repentant sinner.) When the one dragging the cross reached the summit of the spur, some of the penitentes helped to raise the cross he alone had dragged. It seemed impossible for any one man to have accomplished such an act, but we saw him do it. We were several miles from Trinidad and wanted to reach our convent home before the lighter of our globe threw his golden rays to warn us that he soon would retire. Easter Sunday, 1873. I must tell you what information I received concerning the Penitentes. The Way of the Cross, of course, was taught the natives by the good Franciscans; so also penance was preached to them. When the Franciscans were obliged to leave the Southwest, it naturally fell to the stronger-minded and piously inclined to perpetuate what had been taught them, but in this teaching each leader followed his own idea; hence, we find that whilst the members of some lodges are perfectly docile to the teachings of the Church, other lodges have not the least conception of the correct spirit of Catholicity, though they consider themselves good Catholics. The Penitentes in this vicinity do not even make their Easter duty. They do not scruple to abstract cattle from another man's ranch on the Easter Monday, after having scourged themselves on Good Friday and called themselves \"Repentant sinners.\" This reminds one of the private interpretation of the Bible. The Penitentes interpret the teaching of the Franciscans in their own way. The initiation to these lodges varies also. Here is one form: Ridges are made from neck to waist-line with sharp stones. By privilege I was allowed to visit one of their lodges it was literally bespattered with blood side, walls, and ceiling, too yet the members of the lodge I visited are adroit pilferers of any branded domestic animals seen on the plains. These same members never approach the Sacraments. They are condemned by the Church. Easter week Here is a tragedy which took place this week. An elderly lady and gentleman Americans residing a few miles from Trinidad, were found murdered in their home. Suspicion at once pointed to the natives as the perpetrators of the horrible deed. Small groups of men were sent out to capture the murderers. One posse trailed four Mexicans, and because they would not acknowledge the deed, were hanged on the first tree to which they came. Afterwards the corpses were huddled into a wagon, brought to Trinidad in triumph and thrown into an old vacant adobe hut, twelve feet from the graveyard near the Convent. Can you imagine how we felt! Two days later the real murderers were captured and confessed the crime. They were outlawed Americans! Rafael, Indian Chief of the Utes, is on the warpath because the government agents have repeatedly made his tribe \"move on.\" Poor Indians! Will they ever understand that the conquerors claim the land? How quickly the Indian detects true sympathy from the counterfeit! Feast of St Aloysius, 1873. The resident students were to have a free day and enjoy it on the mountains. The pastor's new white Maria (a white covered wagon) and traveling horses had been put at the Sisters' disposal. The driver that was to take the reins came at the last moment 9 o'clock A M, to say he found it impossible to go to the mountains for the day. The young ladies were woefully disappointed. Singularly for me, I did not offer to drive. Sister Marcella said: \"Sister Blandina, unless you take the young ladies to the mountains, they will have a second disappointment. Sister Eulalia can remain with them while you come back for the second load.\" So I started with the first load. The horses had been resting for two weeks and stable-fed during that time. They were horses accustomed to traveling forty or fifty miles a day to and from the various mission posts, consequently use horse sense when they start on their mission journey by not tiring themselves out at the start. When I had driven about six miles, we came to an enticing place to camp for the day. The young girls in great glee jumped to the ground. Keeping the youngest pupil to return with me, I reined the horses' heads toward Trinidad, when lo! I saw at once we had a runaway team. I recalled many horse traits so managed to guide and keep them on the road. Presently I saw our way lay through a very rough road where I had all I could do when driving out to keep clear of large boulders. So I tried my strength against the runaway horses. The reins were new and cut my hands to the bone. The atmosphere here is so clear one can see a great distance ahead, and I saw death if I kept on the road, so I gathered strength by will power and turned the horses to the left of the road on to level ground followed by a ravine. What happened I do not know, but when I awoke I saw the bus turned over, the horses grazing at a distance, the top of the bus about five rods from it, and no sign of my companion. I felt no pain, so I tried to raise the bus one ton needless to say, it did not budge. I began to search for my companion. I could see her nowhere. I went toward the white canopy of the wagon and there, under its shade, was Miss Chené, blood oozing from her nose and no sign of life. I raised her in my arms and said: \"Blessed Mother, you know I had no desire to come out here to-day. I did so through obedience. So, please, see to the life of this child, while I go for the horses.\" When I got to where the horses were grazing I picked up the reins, but horselike they understood they had the best of me, and though I said, \"Get up,\" they did not move; so I changed my system with all the energy I could and repeated, \"Get up!\" They trotted to the place of the upset bus where I tied them to one of the wheels and returned to where I had left my companion in apparent death. She was sitting up and greeted me by saying, \"Oh, Sister, there is blood all over your neck.\" Remember there was not a house in sight, nor any water. Guided by her voice, I wiped my neck and asked her if she could walk. She attempted to get up, but could not. I tried to raise her in order to carry her, but she was as heavy to me as a mountain. So we talked for a while, then attempted to walk to Trinidad. We had walked about half a mile when we saw a country wagon advancing toward us. We knew at once that whoever was in the wagon was coming to our relief. I felt no pain until I knew help was near. The instant I realized the situation, and that the burden would be shared by others, I simply collapsed. It was sheer exercise of will which prevented me from fainting. We were assisted into the wagon and started for Trinidad. On the last descent we met one of the best horsemen in these parts. He said he could see from his ranch that some accident had taken place, so he came with rope and hammer, etc, to be of some service. I remarked, \"As good a horseman as you are, you cannot trust that team.\" He smiled incredulously, but he had a runaway when he attempted to drive to town. He took a jockey's precaution tired the horses before he again turned their heads toward Trinidad. When the pastor met me, he remarked: \"I did not anticipate any trouble with you at the reins.\" I responded: \"Were I to drive that team again, I would surely tire it in sand before trusting it on any road.\" Within the next week, when the Rev gentleman was answering a sick call, the horses started on a gallop which he could not check. When the horses recognized they were the masters, they started at full speed. He was thrown out and was picked up wounded, and had to be brought into Trinidad in someone else's vehicle, leaving his own for repairs. When he came to the convent to have his wounds dressed, he remarked, \"Those horses gave me the surprise of my life no wonder, Sister, you could not hold them in.\" So St Aloysius day, 1873, will not soon be forgotten by me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  </td><td>S1019-D007</td><td>0.071</td><td>0.081</td><td>0.848</td><td> 0.9670</td></tr>\n",
       "\t<tr><th scope=row>6</th><td> July, 1873. Dear Sister Justina: The last time I wrote in this journal I gave you an account of what occurred on St Aloysius day. All intervals of this journal are overcrowded with events not of daily occurrence in the United States. I will note incidents which intimately concern our life work. I've discovered that the wild lemetes make a nice syrup jelly, so we shall have syrup jelly next year added to our ordinary menu. Nearly every housewife in Trinidad has come to the convent to verify the syrup fact. August: Sister Eulalia and myself strolled up the Purgatoire River looking for wild flowers. We found plenty, and also a cluster of wild plum trees plums as delicious as any cultivated plums. The land is \"virgin\" and can be made to yield fruits and vegetables pleasing to the best of agriculturists. Another Indian scare is on. This will stop land-grabbers for a while. Here any dishonest man can become possessor of the acres he covets. It has repeatedly happened that when a land-grabber nails a small house on land acquired by spurious methods, and a grabber more greedy than himself claims this theft, the result is a fight, whoever kills the other, holds possession. Such disturbances are of frequent occurrence; they cause a sensation for a few days, then all is forgotten. But the Mexican cannot forget that all his earthly possessions have gone into the hands of strangers. Woe to the poor native if he attempts to retaliate! He has no rights that the invading fortune hunters feel obliged to respect. Many of our Mexicans hold lands by traditional possession of Mercedes (Grants) and believe they are secure. The land-sharper comes in and proves their claim is not legal. No matter that they have lived on the land for years, the Mexicans must \"vamoos,\" as these corrupters of the Spanish language say. Upon a less legal tenure than the one the Mexican was made to move, the grabber takes possession. The crisis comes when one despoiler is overreached by another artful shark who, during the dark hours of the night, removes the hastily constructed lumber shanty and replaces it by one of his own, having previously torn out any county records which could prove possession. At the dawn of the next day appear on the coveted land the violators of \"Thou shalt not steal,\" ready for what may happen. The usual outcome is that one rogue recognizes the other, and each knows he has but one chance for life, who will shoot first. The last of this series of crimes is: a disappointed, dejected, would-be-rich-quick man trying to drown his disappointment in aqua fortis. Just such a man straggling along the street saw one of our quiet, honest men coming toward him. Was it the sight of goodness that aroused his infernal hatred? Without a word he drew his revolver and shot him. The victim could only say, \"Lord, have mercy on me,\" and expired. This murder aroused the indignation of every citizen. Several men who witnessed the deed caught the murderer and held him till the sheriff came. A mob gathered, and in short time the murderer was condemned to be hanged to a tree near the river, in sight of my schoolroom! The sheriff sent a messenger to ask if I wished to speak to the criminal, with the hope of making him realize the gravity of his crime and that in a few minutes he was to answer to Almighty God for the life of an innocent man. I could not see that my going to the place of retribution would bring good results, consequently, I sent a member of our Vigilant Club to try to induce the criminal to make an act of contrition, but the poor man did not comprehend, or possibly did not wish to, for he said: \"I die game! This is not the first man I made eat the earth. I die game!\" No one except those that have witnessed such a scene can imagine its horror. The hanging was done in broad daylight and as orderly as a funeral train! I mentioned in the first pages of this journal that any prisoner can burrow out of our adobe jail, and since the circuit court comes only at long intervals, it happens that no criminals are ever put on the docket. I visit the jail regularly. And here is how I am able to do it: I offer to be chaperon to the young ladies of the Academy, as most of them love open air and take horse rides on the plains, and so it requires more than ordinary sights to shock or unnerve them. Hence, in our walks, I invariably visit the prisoners. It does both the prisoners and the young ladies good. Among the group that is very fond of fresh air is a Miss C . She has read books of the ex-nun type and the horrors of what they say takes place in Convents. Consequently, she is suspicious and watches the nuns closely. Last Sunday Miss C was so homesick she actually cried out loud. Sister Eulalia was \"Angel\" at the time, and came to ask me if I could not devise something to make Miss Annie forget her homesickness. I went at once to the recreation hall and found the girl sobbing. I said: \"Come, young ladies, let us take a stroll to Simpson's Rest.\" The seniors in my class have made a trail to the top of the \"Rest.\" Miss Annie brightened up at once and said: \"Yes, girls, let's go.\" We started. After crossing the little stream called a river, we had everything to ourselves. The canopy above the plain below, leading to the base of Simpson's Spur. Miss C asked why this spur of the Rockies was named Simpson's Rest. I was glad of anything that would divert her mind, so I narrated what Mr Simpson himself had told me. \"I went on the spur,\" Mr Simpson said, \"to get away from an attack of Indians. I wanted to draw their attention to me so that the few men and women in Trinidad would have time to make preparation for defense. The ruse succeeded, the squad of Indians followed me. I knew every inch of the land, and the shortest cut to the vantage spot, where I could snap off anyone coming to the top of the spur. Two Indians tried to come, and I shot each one in turn. The others of the group so I surmised would make me die of thirst. My provisions were giving out, but the Indians held to their purpose, possibly thinking if they got rid of me, they could make a raid on Trinidad. Meanwhile, the inhabitants had brought as much water as they could store, killed two steers and dried the meat in the sun. In fact, were prepared for a siege. But, apparently, I was the one wanted. Day after day passed. The besiegers did not attempt to ascend to the place of my captivity. I had to hoard my ammunition. I was getting unbearably thirsty when suddenly I recalled a natural cut on the left of the spur where the snow never disappears. Under cover of night. I cautiously crawled to the place and found plenty of snow. I ate all I needed and took a lump with me to my hiding place. I repeated my visit to the cut for more snow. Having something to drink, I knew I could hold out indefinitely. \"At the end of a week the Indians gave the war whoop, no doubt, thinking I was dead. I felt they would climb the mountain for my scalp. Two of the most agile ran ahead of the others. I shot one and reloaded for the other, but he ran out of sight. I was worn out, for I only napped during the day and kept wide awake at night, knowing the warfare methods of the Indians. At the end of the second week I saw my besiegers gallop away, but I did not trust myself to go down to Trinidad. The watchers in Trinidad saw them depart and knew I was alive, because the Indians gave no war whoop, nor showed any scalp. So they dispatched three runners to bring me something to eat and some strong coffee. I saw them coming, and began to descend. When we met, they told me the Indians had made one raid, but were met with such a volley of shots that they did not attempt a second attack.\" George Simpson was a young man from the East. He came West as an adventurer, and became a pioneer hunter and trapper. He married a beautiful Mexican girl, Juanita, and made his home near Trinidad. The following poem written by himself some time after this adventure with the Indians, refers to her as \"one mourner\": SIMPSON'S REST Lay me to rest on you towering height, Where the silent cloud-shadows glide, Where solitude holds its slumberous reign, Far away from the human tide. I fain would sleep near the old pine tree, That looks down on the valley below, Like a soldier guarding a comrade's grave, Or a sentinel watching a foe. 'Twas a refuge once in the bygone time, When a pitiful fate was near, When my days were young and full of love For a life I held too dear. Thro' all the long years that have passed away Since those nights of storm and dread, I've prayed that the boughs that sheltered me then Might wave o'er my breast when dead. Delve deep my grave in the stern gray rock In its rigid embrace let me rest, With naught but my name on the stone And the symbol of Faith on my breast. One mourner perhaps may remember where sleeps In the rock-ribbed tomb, the lone dead, May breathe for the loved one to Heaven, a prayer, A tear to his memory shed. By the time I had narrated what had been told me, we had ascended one-half of the spur. Then Miss Annie and another girl sprang to the front and were following the trial, telling us they were not afraid of mountain cats or any other animal. \"We are ready for any adventure,\" they said. They continued following the trail until they came to a curved projection which hid me from the view of anyone coming in the opposite direction. We had been walking briskly, so no one felt like talking. The two young ladies stopped at the projection. When we reached the curve we heard men's voices. By this time I could see the quizzically amused expression on the faces of the young ladies. Meanwhile the men were saying all sorts of things to the girls while walking toward them, not suspecting the presence of anyone else. As they neared them the girls stepped backward toward us and I went in front of all my protegés. What followed was so comical, that Miss C and her companion had to sit down on the trial to get over their convulsive laughter. The instant the two (what shall I name them?) saw me, they both gave one spring toward the descent, which on their side had no trail. Realizing the law of gravity, I hid my face, believing I would have to notify their friends of their sudden death in their attempt to descend the steep side of Simpson's Rest. The laughter of the girls made me look to where the men had gone down. They had reached the bottom without injury. As soon as Miss C could speak, she changed laughter into seriousness and said: \"I want a catechism, and I want to become a Catholic. Maria Monk and Edith O'Gorman may talk and have books published against Convents but what I saw this afternoon has counteracted all I have ever read derogatory to convents and Sisters.\" Shall I add the two men came early the next day to make an apology? What does this signify? They were afraid to lose the trade of the Convent!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td>S1019-D008</td><td>0.144</td><td>0.083</td><td>0.773</td><td>-0.9993</td></tr>\n",

       "\t1 &  TRINIDAD On Train from Steubenville, Ohio, to Cincinnati. Nov 30, 1872. My Darling Sister Justina: How interestedly you, Sister M Louis and myself read Eugénie de Guérin's Journal and her daily anxieties to save her brother from being a spiritual outcast! This Journal which I propose keeping for you will deal with incidents occurring on my journey to Trinidad and happenings in that far-off land to which I am consigned. The Journal will begin with the first act. Here is Mother Josephine's letter: Mt St Vincent, O, Nov 27, 1872. Sister Blandina, Steubenville, O My Dear Child: You are missioned to Trinidad. You will leave Cincinnati Wednesday and alone. Mother Regina will attend to your needs. Devotedly, Mother Josephine. This letter thrilled us both. I was delighted to make the sacrifice, and you were hiding your feelings that I might not lose any merit. Neither of us could find Trinidad on the map except in the island of Cuba. So we concluded that Cuba was my destination. I was to leave Steubenville quietly so that none of my obstreperous pupils might cause the incoming teacher annoyance. Hence I went to Sunday catechetical class as usual 2:00 P M I was to take the 3:00 P M train for Cincinnati. I said to my hopefuls, \"Instead of catechism, I'm going to tell you an Indian story to-day.\" The schoolhouse roof was not disturbed, though the hurrahs were loud enough! The moral of the story was \"Indian Endurance.\" Dismissed them at two-thirty without one word of goodbye except the daily one. You remember how surprised I was to see a crowd at the station to wish me \"Godspeed\"; I thought I was to slip away without anyone's knowledge except our own. Mr Tait and Mr McCann wished to speak to me alone. Both had been in the West. \"You will have a long travel on the plains,\" they said, \"before you reach Trinidad.\" \"Where is Trinidad?\" \"A little mining town in Southwestern Colorado.\" So then I knew my destination, which, of course I would have been told at Mt St Vincent. Both gentlemen said they had traveled on the plains on the Santa Fe Trail, and they seemed to have made it a matter of conscience to inform me on the subject of cowboys. This in substance was their conversation with me: \"Sister, you may be snow-bound while on the plains.\" I looked my assent, I knew I could not stop the snow. \"Travelers are sometimes snow-bound for two weeks, and you are alone. This, though, is not the greatest danger to you.\" Mentally I was wishing both gentlemen somewhere else. \"Your real danger is from cowboys.\" I looked at the speakers. \"You do not seem to grasp our meaning. No virtuous woman is safe near a cowboy.\" Both gave up trying to make me understand what they considered danger. Why should snow or cowboys frighten me any more than others who will be traveling the same way! So you see, dearest, I'm not going to so long a distance as we thought. At three o'clock A M the baggage checker came through our coach. I looked to see how much the pocketbook contained just twenty-five cents. If I used it to ride to the Good Samaritan I'd be minus the fare to Mt St Vincent, so I made up my mind to skirt around from the Little Miami to the Good Samaritan Hospital. At four A M I rang the front doorbell no response. I sat on the stone steps and waited till I heard the rising bell, then I waited another fifteen minutes when again I rang the doorbell. Sister Anthony came. \"Why, child, where did you come from; how did you get here? I'm sure you are cold.\" I said I came from Steubenville. \"Oh, yes! dear Father Bigelow died there. He was good to this hospital. Last year he sent a barge of coal to us.\" I said he was good to anyone in need. He died possessed of three dollars and fifty cents. His hand was always open to any kind of distress. I did not mention to Sister Anthony that I walked from the Little Miami Station. After Mass, breakfast and miles of sympathy and \"God Bless You\" from the Sisters at the Good Samaritan, one of the nurses accompanied me to Fifth and Vine Streets, where I was to take \"Barney's Bus\" for Mt St Vincent. The bus was to leave at ten A M I waited till three P M then asked one of the clerks if he thought Mr McCabe would run the bus that day. \"I fear no bus will run to-day. There is an epidemic epizootic among the horses.\" I asked if Mr Segale's place of business was anywhere near. He pointed to Wood's Theater and I started to the place indicated. Brother Henry managed to find a \"hack\" to send me to Mt St Vincent. On the way, between the first ascent of the hill and the Seminary, I met Sisters Gabriella and Delphina walking in the slush and cold on their way to the Orphan Asylum. I stopped to take them in. They returned with me to Cedar Grove, from there the driver was to take them to the Asylum in Cumminsville. Sister Gabriella said to me, \"I would gladly go where you are going instead of shouldering this heavy burden.\" Sister is to be mother to three hundred orphans, taking Sister Sophia's place. The Sisters are showing great sympathy. I heard Sister Benedicta say, \"She does not mind going so far and alone I've not seen her shed a tear.\" Nor will you, my dear Sister. The tears will flow where none but He and myself will know. Still, I'm delighted to go. I did not tell you, dearest, that one year ago last November I wrote to Mother Regina saying I envied the sacrifices the Sisters were making who were sent far away to do God's work. I've received my answer with compound interest. You know that up to date the Sisters going on distant missions were consulted and none were sent who had parents living. I am pleased that that record is broken in my case. Mother Regina told me to spend a day at home. Dear Lord! Give me strength. I anticipate a scene. I spent Wednesday, December 5th, at our old homestead. Mother kept open house all day. Friends came in groups. Mr Leverone and bride, his mother and the bride's mother, Mrs Garibaldi, the Misses Gardelli and a host of others. Mrs Garibaldi threatened to take off my habit. I said, \"Hands off! Have you any right to detain Mary if John wishes to take her to California?\" \"Oh, that is different.\" \"Yes, as different as heaven and earth. I have chosen my portion, Mary has chosen hers, each abides by her choice.\" John Leverone's mother acted most sensibly all day. She was soothing oil to all the protests made to my going. Our dear mother kept quiet. When we were permitted a lone interview she asked, \"Do you want one of your sisters to accompany you?\" I answered, \"I prefer to do just as my superiors have told me.\" \"Well, then I will give you a thousand-dollar check so that in case you desire to return you will have the wherewith.\" \"No, no, dear mother, I fully realize the responsibilities I assumed. As you are aware, I realized them from the first day I entered the Novitiate.\" Mother replied: \"And I want to tell you I never doubted your vocation. I agree to your sacrifice, my dear child, keep on serving God, I will never interfere. Now that I have your explicit answer, friends cannot urge any logical reason to prevent your going.\" All day the visitors reminded me of a disturbed ant hill. When mother and I were alone she spoke the Genoese dialect. It was like hearing sketches of a favorite opera. Wednesday at 2:00 P M I went to visit our Ecclesiastical Superior. The Most Rev J B Purcell offered me several gifts. But St Francis Xavier is my patron, so I'm not going to possess any superfluous article, I only regret I could not pass our home without going in, as St Francis Xavier did. If I aim high I surely must reach some upper strata of detachment in His service. One thing I take with me, the impressive blessing given me by His Grace, part of which rings clear \"May angels guard your every step.\" He was extremely sympathetic at my having to go alone. I went to confession to Rev Dr Callaghan. You may recall how we enjoyed his lecture on the \"School Question\" delivered in Steubenville. After mother had a short interview with me, father managed to see me alone. He took hold of me and asked, \"Have I ever denied you anything?\" I signified no. \"You have never disobeyed me in your life?\" I assented. \"Now I command you you must not go on this far away mission! Are you going?\" \"Yes, father.\" He let go the hold on my arm and walked toward the door. Not without my seeing his tears falling fast. He did not realize his hold on my arm gave me pain not to speak of the heart-pain for him. In the railway station at St Louis between train time, I got off to purchase a pair of arctics. I saw several Italian women selling fruit. One of them had a daughter standing near. I asked the mother if she would permit her daughter to accompany me to the shoe store, which was in sight. The mother looked at me earnestly then said to her neighbor peddler, \"How do I know who she is, she looks like a monica (sister) but she might be a strega (witch).\" I thanked the true guardian of her daughter and went to make my purchase alone. I spoke English to the peddler. If good Sister Benedicta who thought I did not mind because I did not cry had seen me during the greater part of last night she would but too truly have said, \"That heart is human in every fiber.\" That I succeeded in dignifiedly getting away from home is Thy Grace, oh, my God! Forty-two persons accompanied me to the train, among them friends of old, but my purpose never faltered, not even in shadow. Such tactics as I executed yesterday! I see one trait strong in me, the straight service of God. Not the father whom I had never seen cry, nor the most patient, dearest mother whose heart is crushed at my being sent alone, much less the friends who used every argument to make me say I would not go could elicit the faintest trace that I was not more pleased at my going alone than if I had had a dozen with me. Sisters Antonia and Gonzaga came to the waiting room. I asked the company to permit me an interview with the Sisters. When going toward them, one of my dear old friends said, \"Look, we cannot doubt she is happy.\" This was not intended for my hearing, the noise caused the speaker to raise her voice. Sister Antonia asked me how I had spent the day. I narrated some incidents. \"I'm an ancient religious, but I could not have gone through the ordeal as creditably as you did.\" What if I had mentioned all the heart sighs I had witnessed! When it was time to board the train I asked that my last interview be with my mother. Cannot you picture her sad, endearing look of appreciation? I'll skip the last talk with mother some of it was in silence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            & S1019-D002 & 0.051 & 0.131 & 0.818 &  0.9994\\\\\n",
       "\t2 &  Kansas City, Dec 6, 1872. Number one! Number two! Number three! I went toward omnibus number three. \"Any convent in this city?\" I asked. \"Yes, ma'am, step in.\" When the bus drove on the convent avenue, I saw the whole place was lighted up. I rang the doorbell and it was answered instantly. I said to the Sisters, \"Did you expect me?\" \"No, Sister.\" \"How, then, did you respond so quickly?\" \"We expected a Sister on this train. We are staying up with a dead Sister who will be buried tomorrow. In your case it is fortunate the Sister did not come you can occupy the room prepared for her the only spare room in the convent.\" Previous to this explanation, I had quickly reasoned: Superiors at home watched the papers saw the railroad accident wired the convent the result being the illumination and Sisters waiting. It did not occur to me that there might be more than one convent in Kansas City. The next turn of affairs brought me to the reality of my position. The two Sisters who had opened the door went to report the non-appearance of the one expected and my coming. Presently the Sisters returned, but their countenances had a dejected look. I became apprehensive at once and asked: \"What is it, Sisters?\" \"Our Superior wants to know if it is customary for your Sisters to travel alone?\" said one. \"No, Sister, it is not.\" \"Have you your letter of obedience?\" \"I destroyed it before starting on this journey. I have no credentials to show except the name on my wearing apparel.\" \"Why are you traveling alone?\" \"Because I was sent alone.\" With this explanation they left me to make a second report. When they returned they were more dejected than before. The elder of the two Sisters spoke: \"Sister, our Superior thinks you had better go to some hotel.\" \"Sisters, I have been well provided for my journey, but I cannot set people thinking by leaving the hospitality of a convent to seek shelter in some hotel. I clearly see I'm considered some sort of a fake, however, if you will kindly let me rest on that sofa, you can allay your fears by locking the door and taking the key with you.\" They went to make a third report. When they returned it was a pleasure to see their cheerful faces. One spoke, \"No, Sister, we are going to prepare a lunch for you.\" \"Please do not. This is the First Friday of the month and a Holy Communion day for me.\" The last vestige of doubt and fear disappeared from their countenances. A pillow and comfort were placed on the sofa and bidding me good rest, they locked the door, taking the key with them. At six o'clock A M, I was shown to the chapel. After Mass I noticed some hesistancy as how to proceed with me. Would they leave me in the convent, or have me join in the funeral procession to their graveyard? Presently I felt a light thump at the left of the priedieu on which I knelt. I looked and saw a hand holding a candle for me to take I understood I was to fall in line. After the funeral, breakfast was served me in the same room in which I had rested. About ten o'clock A M, the Superior came to interview me. I saw the handwriting on the wall, I was an impostress. Had time from interview until three o'clock to myself. During this interval I wrote. Among the jottings I wrote a letter to dear Sister Gabriella, telling her I was in a religious convent at Kansas City, but was considered some one in disguise. I told her I was glad it was I instead of Sister Justina, because her sensitiveness would make her suffer intensely. I am taking the whole incident as some of the many things that may happen to me on my journey to the Southwest. At three o'clock P M, I asked for a companion to accompany me to order the omnibus for the midnight train. After placing my order, I turned to the clerk and said, \"Be sure to send the bus.\" When I reached the exit door I returned to where the clerk was standing, and said, \"It is absolutely necessary for me to take the outgoing midnight train. Under no consideration neglect to have the omnibus come for me.\" He assured me again the order was properly placed and would be attended to. The train that brought me from St Louis had been delayed two hours, owing to the accident which had occured to the train ahead of ours. There is only one daily (nightly) train from this place to the terminus of the road. Dinner and supper were served me as breakfast had been. I am hoping that some of the Sisters will come in to relieve my mind and tell me what speices of a scarecrow I am thought to be. It is seven o'clock no one has come in so far some one now. \"You poor child! What must you think of us and the spirit of this convent?\" I did not have time to answer, for a voice called, \"Sister Martha!\" Sister Martha grasped her lighted candle and briskly followed the voice. I mentally observed that we would not carry a lighted candle through corridors and rooms. However, I have enough to think about without letting fire insurance policies annoy me. The room is dark, a reflection from a lamp-post in the street throws a small stream of light in one window. I still have fully four hours before the bus calls for me. \"Angels guard your every step.\" I'm going to rest on the sofa. I heard a voice, \"Sister?\" I sat erect. \"Mother wants to know if you are sure you ordered the bus?\" Was it my want of rest or injured feeling of pride which was on the verge of giving vent to my thoughts? From the gleam of light that came from the lamp-post I noticed that the speaker was a novice. \"Surely, Sister Blandina, you will not scandalize an aspirant in His service!\" While silently speaking thus to myself I looked at the young novice. She had a good placid face, and I said, \"Sister, please say to your Superior that I surely ordered the bus.\" She bowed and left me. Now, dearest Sister Justina, if by some unthinkable reason the omnibus does not come for me, I am positively certain the police will! \"Angels guard your every step.\" How happy I am that you, dear, are not in this predicament. I am arranging my speech to the policeman. I hear him say, \"The nuns sent for me to show you the way to any hotel you wish to go to!\" and I shall say, \"I do not wish to go to any hotel. Be kind enough to wire to the Most Rev J B Purcell, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for any information you desire about me.\" I see a note of intelligence appear on his countenance while he critically studies me but through it all I cannot see myself going to any hotel. Though the suspense of not knowing what may happen makes me uneasy. Twenty minutes after eleven I hear the patter of horses' hoofs on the convent avenue. Deo Gratias. When I realized the omnibus had come for me, I put on my wraps and with my traveling black basket walked toward the door. It was opened by a Sister in the hall. Then it was I noticed this Sister had performed the work of a sentinel, guarding me! My impulse was to brush by her and into the bus. But telepathy worked quicker than impulse. Right reason was on their side. Instant remembrance recalled the fact that a few months previous I was given charge of two dressed as Franciscan Sisters and who were making a collection in Steubenville. I was to attend to them and they were not to associate with the Sisters. The day which was to be their last with us, and when they were on their way to the station to leave the town, a policeman tapped one of the two and said, \"Both of you come with me.\" The guardian of the law had seen a big foot encased in a boot. One was a man, the other his wife, who personified Franciscan Sisters. So instead of acting by impulse, I said: \"Please, Sister, say a fervent prayer that I may reach my destination in safety.\" I saw a glistening tear of sympathy. Was I not reaping reward for suppressing a hasty impulse? Nothing noticeable took place from the time the train left Kansas City until we reached the terminus of the railroad. A few scattered frame houses and the place is called Coolage. (I am spelling this name phonetically). A train was being made up of constructive material and at the end of the train I saw a very shabby coach from the windows of which a number of men were craning their necks looking at me. Gazing in every direction, I finally saw the train conductor. I went toward him and asked if I might board the made-up train for Kit Carson. He said: \"To-morrow we will put on a day coach; this is only a construction train carrying construction material and a crowd of Irish workmen to Kit Carson.\" \"Any objection to my going with them?\" \"Not if you can put up with a working man's ‘smoker.’\" I went toward the train. The conductor assisted me into the coach. The instant the Irishmen saw a Sister their hats came off and pipes were taken out of their mouths. When seated, I said to the two men in front of me: \"Please say to these good men that I am very fond of smoke from a pipe.\" The men replaced their hats and resumed their smoking. I doubt which side was more pleased they, to have me, or I to be with them. We reached Kit Carson shortly after midnight. When \"End of Construction line\" was called, one of the men stepped over to me and offered to carry my basket. I handed it to him; then, a gentleman bowed and gave me a letter. The one who had my basket waited to see what would happen. I read the letter and saw by its contents I was to follow the giver of the letter. Thanking the courtesy of the first man I let myself be guided by the second. This was Mr Mullen, an agent of Otero and Seller, the greatest commission firm of the Southwest. The loaded caravans of this firm are constantly on the Santa Fe Trail. My instructions from Mother Regina are: \"Wait in Kit Carson until the Sisters from Trinidad come for you.\" The letter handed me is from Sister Marcella, in charge of the Trinidad School Mission. It says, \"Take the stage and come on to Trinidad.\" Kit Carson, Colorado, Dec 8, 1872 This is the feast of the Immaculate Conception, and the anniversary of making our vows. I wonder what you are doing, dear Sister Justina, while I am trying to solve the problem of either going or staying here to-day. The facts are these: Had I not been compelled to wait over twenty-two hours in Kansas City, I should have arrived here in time to take the stage that would have brought me into Trinidad on the morning of the Feast of the Immaculata. Mother Regina's instruction ceases with the new order. Only exceptionally do we travel on Sundays and feast days of obligation, so I will order the stage for to-morrow and begin a little catechetical missionary work to-day. No better feast could inaugurate my new life. When I said Grace before breakfast, I noticed how gravely the junior Mullen looked at me; which gives me the best guarantee he hasn't been taught his prayers. I asked Mrs Mullen if she had any objection to my taking James on the plains to watch the habits of the prairie dogs. She said, \"I am glad to have him go, but prairie dogs have queer habits, they cannot be caught unless they are cornered in a place where they have no burrows.\" So Jamie and myself started to watch the prairie dogs. The little midgets remained on their artificial mounds until we got quite near them, then barked their peculiar baby bark, when, with a still more singular wheezy bark, turned and bounded into their subterranean houses. Shall we ever learn the language of the lower animals! It was very plain we could not catch any of the little creatures, so I turned my attention to my young companion. \"Can you bless yourself?\" \"Like you did at breakfast?\" \"Exactly.\" \"Daddy said I ought to know how to do what you did.\" \"Shall I teach you?\" \"Oh! good, I will surprise daddy!\" I began with the Sign of the Cross. He learned quickly. I repeated the first part of the Lord's Prayer by periods many times. Then played catcher and tried again to run down a prairie dog. The little fellow was more anxious to learn than to play; which pleased me very much. By the time we went in to dinner, he had passably memorized the Lord's Prayer, Hail Mary and Grace before and after meals, so at dinner he silently said Grace with me. Mrs Mullen told me that three ladies had called to see me and would return this afternoon. We had buffalo meat for dinner. While on the train from Coolage (Colidge) to Kit Carson we saw a herd of buffalo. The herd was on a stampede. The brutes did look crazy; plainly, whatever direction they made for, nothing could stop them. Someone on the train remarked that it was surprising to see a herd of buffalo, as Kit Carson and Dick Wooten (both frontier trappers) had declared there were no more buffalo in herds. One might see a small group here and there on the plains, but a herd of buffalo was out of the question. Yet we saw one. The three ladies called again. They were anxious to be sympathetic at my traveling alone and so young! But they soon convinced themselves I needed no sympathy in my prospective workThe stage will call for me in the morning. I was told I am the only passenger booked for to-morrow. Mrs Mullen is having clean hay ready to put in the coach. I expected there would be others in the stagecoach with me. \"Angels guard your footsteps.\"  & S1019-D004 & 0.055 & 0.111 & 0.834 &  0.9993\\\\\n",
       "\t3 &  Trinidad, December 10, 1872. My dearest dear: Here I am safe in Trinidad, Colorado Territory, instead of in the island of Cuba where we first thought I was to go. No wonder this small pebble (Trinidad, Colo) is not on our maps. \"Angels guide your footsteps.\" This sentence has stayed with me from the time I left the Archbishop's residence in Cincinnati, and is with me still. In Kit Carson I ordered the stage for the morning of the 9th Mrs Mullen was very attentive. She had new clean hay put in the stage to keep my feet warm, and after I got in she wrapped a large comfort around me, remarking that \"traveling on the plains and in winter was not a pleasant prospect.\" The driver must have had strict injunctions from Otero and Seller they own the stage line. For the first time I had indefinable fears. The cowboys were constantly in my mind. I expected there would be a number traveling with me on the plains. \"Snow-bound and cowboys\" came in thought to annoy me. At noon the driver came to the stage door and said: \"We take dinner here.\" I thanked him and said: \"I do not wish any dinner.\" \"But, lady, we will not have another stopping place to eat until six o'clock this evening.\" I thanked him again, \"but I do not wish any dinner.\" The jolting of the stage and my thoughts had taken all appetite away. Though I could see nothing from the stage, (every flap was fastened) it seemed that the driver aimed to drive over every stone and make the wheels go into every rut. It was nothing but a jerk up and down all the way in a stage that had no springs and traveling at the rate of twelve miles an hour! At six o'clock we arrived at the station for supper. At every station the mules were changed. The driver came to ask me to supper. I thanked him, but said: \"I do not wish any supper.\" \"There will not be another chance for a meal until twelve o'clock to-night, and you have not tasted anything to-day, so come now and take it if only a cup of black coffee.\" \"No, thank you, I have no desire for anything.\" The poor man was quite distressed. He could not think I was trying to save traveling expenses, because the price of stage traveling included meals. Here is the mental attitude I was in: If the driver could surmise the vague fear that is preying on me he would know I have no appetite. He went in to supper and presently returned. \"Lady, if you do not want to eat come in and let me have my supper. The woman who runs this station will not give me a drink of muddy water unless I fetch you in to supper I told her how you are dressed and she goes off wild and says: ‘Bring her in or you will get nothing to eat to-night, nor any other time you come.’\" I went into an adobe, log-raftered, mud-floored, mud-plastered hut. The sight of the red checkered table cloth and black coffee only added to my repugnance for food. The person who kept the station was an Irish woman of the good old stamp. I made an effort to sip some coffee, but not a drop would pass my lips. The cowboys were in my mind. I tried to ascertain if there were any in the vicinity, the answers I received were indefinite. At midnight: \"Now, lady, you will have a good meal.\" \"No, thank you, I desire nothing.\" \"What will Otero and Seller say to me when they find out you did not take a meal during this journey? They gave me more orders about you than I ever got since I'm staging, and that's ten years.\" \"Say I wished for nothing. I will write the firm my thanks.\" Oh, the lonely, fearful feeling! The night was dark. No passengers to allay my turbulent thoughts. Foot-steps drew near the stage. My heart was thumping. The driver opened the stage door and said: \"You will have a traveling companion for some miles.\" In the open door, by the light of the lantern, I saw a tall, lanky, hoosier-like man, wearing a broad brimmed hat. On one arm he had a buffalo robe. While I sat riveted, he got in asked me if I would take part of his \"kivver,\" and before my fright permitted me to speak, he placed part of the buffalo robe over the comfort that enwrapped me, and sat beside me on the rear seat. The driver closed the door and we were in utter darkness. By descriptions I had read I knew he was a cowboy! With crushing vividness \"No virtuous woman is safe near a cowboy\" came to me. I made an act of contrition concentrated my thoughts on the presence of God thought of the Archbishop's blessing, \"Angels guard your steps,\" and moved to such position as would put my heart in range with his revolver. I expected he would speak I answer he fire. The agony endured cannot be written. The silence and suspense unimaginable. Suddenly from out the darkness I heard: \"Madam!\" \"Sir!\" \"What kind of a lady be you?\" \"A Sister of Charity.\" \"Whose sister?\" \"Everyone's Sister, a person who gives her life to do good to others.\" \"Quaker like, I reckon?\" \"No, not quite.\" By this time I learned from his tone of voice that I had nothing to fear. He asked me a number of questions, all prompted by a conversation he had had with the driver before he came into the stage. In my turn I asked him why he became a cowboy. He said he had read of cowboys and ran away from home to become one. \"Is your mother still living?\" \"Yes, I allow she is leastwise she was when I left home six years ago. \"Have you written to her?\" \"No, madam, and I allow that's beastly.\" \"It is certainly unkind to one whom you can always trust and who, I am sure, loves you as much now as she did when you were a little fellow.\" His voice got husky. \"What do you say I otter do?\" \"Write; do so as soon as you get off this stage. Tell her you will soon make her a visit, and see to it that you keep your word.\" \"I will, so help me God! I was mighty feared to speak to you when I got in, because the mule driver said you was more particular than any lady he ever seen. I allow I am powerful glad I spoke to you.\" To think that this lubberly, good-natured cowboy had made me undergo such mortal anguish. He got off on the outskirts of Trinidad where the driver stopped to point out to me dugouts at the side of the foothills. \"This, lady, is Trinidad.\" A fainting feeling came over me as I looked at what I would have thought were kennels for dogs. Then I remembered my perfect health, the many years in the order of nature, before my call would come. While these thoughts were dominating, bright and vivid came to my vision the life of St Francis Xavier, farther away, in a more desolate country, with less companions, and yet who did more for God? Though I know the driver continued to talk, I do not recall a word he said. There on the outskirts facing the dugouts of Trinidad I took St Francis Xavier as my model in the missionary life. The stage stopped to throw off the mail. While so doing, a gentleman, wearing a Roman collar and having a clerical look, came to the stage door and said: \"Ya, ya, Sister, come out. This is the Convent,\" pointing to a store, which, at a glance I could see was being used for post-office and general store. He made a motion to help me out. I put my hands in my habit sleeves and sat upright in the stage, acknowledging his proffered courtesy by \"Thank you, I'll stay here.\" The gentleman's eyes twinkled merrily and he walked briskly away. A few minutes after the driver came out, took the reins and drove off. Another stopping place. The driver opened the door and said: \"Here we are.\" Before making any attempt to leave the stage, I looked at the house and in the recess of the door saw two of our Sisters. I thought, this is more like it, and was helped in by Sisters Marcella and Fidelis. The gentleman who had come to the stage door is the parish priest who wanted to see as he expressed it \"what kind of a Sister is she who was sent across the plains alone.\" He wanted to give an agreeable surprise by playing a joke. Before the stage reached the convent, he managed to say to the Sisters: \"You cannot play jokes on her.\" To-day is Mother Regina's birthday, and my first day West. I will continue this journal and some years hence send it to you, dear Sister Justina. I'm not to go in school until the 6th of January, 1873. I began to review my Spanish. Rev P J Munnecum, the parish priest, is the teacher. To my surprise, the Sisters do not speak Spanish. My previous study of the language is a great help to me and has created a desire in the Sisters to study the language also. December 14, 1872 I am sure, dearest Sister Justina, you will be interested in my viewpoint of things as I find them here. To-day I went to look at my schoolroom to be; 40 ft long; 14 ft wide; 8 ft high; two small windows, lowsized door, no transom; solid adobe walls on two sides, log rafters as black as ebony. Of necessity ventilation said \"Goodbye\" when the house was completed. But I must add all these adobe houses were built with a view to protect the inhabitants in case of a sudden attack from the warring Indians. That does not mean that every house has these dimensions. The head of each family built to suit his taste in the matter of length, breadth, and height but material to date is unchangeable: sunburnt mud (shaped, of course) 4×9×18 inches; the foundation the same as walls, mud roof over rafters mud floors. There are some seventyfive of these houses on \"Mexican Hill.\" That will be my first objective point; the second will be the jail. The Purgatoire River corrupted into Picatwar, but the natives kept its correct name, Purgatorio is below the acequia, (artificial canal) which is the boundary line to land and house given by Mr Filippe Baca, one of the leading citizens here, to the Sisters for a school. The land on which the Academy is built (now in course of erection) was donated by a Mr Heone, who lives a few miles outside of Trinidad. This gentleman and Dr Beshoar, our physician, have pews in the church if you can call eight planks nailed together, pews. The Sisters use the choir loft. The church is an adobe structure with a pretense of a gable roof and a double pretense of having been shingled; mud floor, mud walls, wooden candlesticks. Previous to the Sisters coming, bottles were used for candlesticks. The only restful spot about the church are the grounds to the entrance of it. The graveyard is in the rear of the church with a street between graveyard and convent. There is a long stretch of an adobe wall from convent (academy) to public school, the only one here and taught by the Sisters. I am told there is an Academy (called \"Rice\") maintained by the Methodists. We have twelve resident young ladies at the Academy, occupying the part that is built; very few in the select school. The Sisters are: Sister Marcella, in charge and music teacher; Sister Martha, Housekeeper; Sister Eulalia, Factotum; Sister Fidelis, Select School; Sister Blandina, Public School Teacher; Sister Eulalia, Assistant. Here is the Trinidad of today: Commercial Street, a few scattered houses the length of two blocks. Main Street, a few scattered stores occupying one side of the street about the same length as Commercial Street. Convent Street, we use to the end of the Public School grounds, where there are a few small adobe huts. So far, Mr Baca has the only house that looks like a residence. Then there is the Mexican settlement on the hill. I am informed that very few prisoners ever come to trial. They manage to burrow out from jail before the Circuit Court convenes. The Circuit Court comes from Denver. Here, if you have a largeness of vision, you find the opportunity to exercise it; if a cramped one, the immense expanse of the plains, the solid Rockies, the purity of the atmosphere, the faultlessness of the canopy above, will stretch the mind toward the Good. Maybe, dearest, it may please you to know my own attitude at the present writing. Vede mio cuore. (Look at my heart). I wish I had many hands and feet, and a world full of hearts to place at the service of the Eternal. So much one sees to be done, and so few to do it. I have adopted this plan: Do whatever presents itself, and never omit anything because of hardship or repugnance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        & S1019-D005 & 0.056 & 0.101 & 0.843 &  0.9987\\\\\n",
       "\t4 &  December 21. Rumor is loud in predicting an attack from the Ute tribe. We have a girl at the Academy named Ida Chené, whose mother gave me a vivid account of a sudden attack from one of the roving wild Indian tribes. The purpose of the attack was to drive out all who were not Mexicans this tribe had allied itself with the Mexicans. The outbreak took place near Taos. Mrs Chené was in the field plowing when the macheté was raised over her head and she was asked to pronounce the word juangoche. She did so to the satisfaction of the attacking group, who galloped away either to cleave or scalp the next who could not pronounce the word correctly. It is singular that not any of these things can cause me to fear. We have our own chapel. Very few Catholic Americans in Trinidad. The Church on Sunday is crowded by our native population, who come from many directions. Vehicles of every description bring the devout. Not a native woman wears any other covering on head except a mantella or shawl, and they kneel on the bare floor, and, let me add, they know how to pray and do it. In our well-to-do churches East, to secure musical harmony, professors and trained singers are engaged; in the congregations of mediocre wealth, the best talent give their service, attend rehearsals and sing when required. Yet in both elements there is a constant friction, if not always expressed, a felt dissatisfaction, and it is frequently a subject of annoyance to the Catholic conscience as to whether or not the duty of assisting at Mass is complied with by the choir attendants. The congregation, from youth to age, is ever ready to criticise the director, organist, individual singers, and choir. In the combined action of choir and congregation, how much intrinsic honor is rendered to God! He, alone, is the Judge. Now bring your attention to a close view of a scene in this church. The performers are two greyhaired men, each holding a large violin. The instrument reclines against the left knee, which is in position to rise when the signal is given that Mass has begun; right knee bent to the ground, eyes closed and head inclined. The priest begins, Et introibo, etc The violin players, with voice and instrument, strike off a half-singing, half reciting Kyrie, etc The violins seldom strung to the same pitch. On great feast-days one, sometimes two, guitars are added, no two instruments tuned in unison, but who can doubt that every heart beats in harmony with that of the celebrant. A short time after the Sisters' arrival (1870), at the request of the priest and the English speaking portion of the congregation, the music teacher took charge of choir and began gradually to train pupils to sing in church services, the congregation contenting itself by chiming in when one of its old-time hymns was sung. Even that died out, leaving Dona Juanita Simpson to lead a chorus when Los Americanos are not in the church. Preparations are being made for a Christmas Tree. It is to be in the select schoolroom. I notice that two of our Italian musicians are active in seeing that the tree is well loaded, and I further remark that only the resident pupils and Sisters will share from the tree. I'm only glancing over occurrences. By another year I shall have things clear in my mind. Some of our Eastern showmen, say Barnum of New York, or Robinson of Cincinnati, could make an addition to their curios if they so desired. Witness this feat in our unprovided gymnasium. After this, never I say \"crazy as a bd bg .\" We go to the table, seat ourselves as comfortably as the long benches will permit, begin a nice chat on the rare atmosphere, white clouds and ether blue; in lieu of having changed yesterday's menu from bread, meat and water to water, meat and bread. While our spirits clash with our wits, a number of knowing odoriferous acrobats let themselves drop from the rafter on to our midday spread. Their knowledge in mind reading is great everything is left for them to eat!!! To exclude these celebrated chinchi, we are going to change our dining room. Menu will be on the same lines. But our chef thinks we may soon expect a change. January 10, 1873 I know, dear Sister Justina, you would undoubtedly be very much pleased had you my pupils. You would have abundance of material for evolution. I have always given you credit for evolving the best from any character, not only morally, but intellectually as well. I doubt if the ages of my pupils would be as satisfactory to you, the majority are older than myself, and some tower fifteen inches above my head. To-day my capacity for controlling them was put to the test. You know I'm a companion outside of the schoolroom, and a teacher the instant the threshold of the schoolroom is crossed. Felipe Gurulé, son of a wealthy Mexican and a natural leader, said to the older pupils this morning: \"Oiga muchachos listen, boys, at the 10 o'clock recess when Sister calls class, do not file in, just to see what the little lady will do.\" He spoke in Spanish and thought I did not understand him. Previous to ringing the recess bell, I called the young man and told him to remain in the room, as I wished to speak to him. When the room was vacated, I asked him to throw windows and doors open for ventilation. Having done so, he took his seat, waiting to hear what I had to say. I went to my desk, scribbled a few notes, then rang the bell for second school session; the pupils, not having a leader \"Just to see what the little lady will do\" filed in as usual. There was suppressed mirth, but nothing obstreperous. When the pupils were seated, I called Felipé and asked if he would not like a few moments' airing. He smiled and went out. At the noon dismissal, he returned and asked, \"Sister, did you understand what I said to the boys this morning?\" I answered that I did. \"Then you speak Spanish?\" \"You may judge when a chance offers,\" I replied. The afternoon session was a revelation to me, every-one was so attentive and so pleased. I wonder what the next attempt on the teacher will be for boys will be boys all the world over. A worried mother came to me to-day. \"Sister, I have three boys men, all of them. I heard them say they want to come to your school. I'm afraid to let ‘Dwarf’ come. John and Jeff are all right, but ‘Dwarf’ fights worse than a bulldog when you try to take meat from it.\" \"Send them and do not worry,\" I told her. John and Jeff came to school. No teacher could desire better behaved pupils, nor any more anxious to learn. The worried mother was afraid to let \"Dwarf\" come. John spoke to me of \"Dwarf\" and said, \"If he comes it will take my mind off my studies, because I will have to watch that he does not get into a fight or break some of the school rules. Yet I wish he would come. I never heard him express a wish to be with any teacher before.\" \"Bring him, John, and before he comes mention the few rules. ‘No tobacco to be used in or around the school premises; no vulgarity in word or action.’ These two rules ought not to deter anyone anxious to study from coming to school.\" \"Dwarf\" came. John watched him as closely as an eagle does its prey. Two weeks have passed since \"Dwarf\" made his appearance. Behavior good. February 5 This day will be memorable for the pupils of Public School No 1. Jefferson came to my desk at recess time; he wanted to speak to me. \"Well, Jefferson, what do you wish to say?\" I asked. \"Sister, I want to study your religion.\" \"There are a number of things you would have to do which might not be to your liking,\" I remarked. \"Name one of the things, Sister.\" \"Confession.\" \"That means to tell everything wrong I do?\" \"It means that, with a plus and plus.\" \"What is the first plus?\" \"To be sorry you did wrong.\" \"And the second?\" \"To resolve not to do that wrong again.\" \"Dwarf,\" standing at the schoolroom door, looked at us both, his eyes flashing anger. He came toward Jefferson, raised his fist and hit him on his left jaw. I felt certain the jaw was broken. Jefferson looked at me, my eyes said, \"Keep still.\" \"Dwarf\" expected Jefferson to jump at him, and stood at defense. I broke the silence by addressing Jefferson, and said \"I'll put arnica on your face, Jefferson, and meanwhile, take your seat.\" A number of pupils anticipating trouble quietly gathered near the schoolroom door to witness the scene which they expected to take place. Every instant was a psychological one. The pupils intent in protecting the teacher against an infuriated human being who stood with blazing eyes and ready arms, waiting an onslaught on him from somewhere, but ready to annihilate anyone who would dare touch him. Jefferson went to his seat. I looked at the clock and said, \"Recess time is up,\" and rang the bell. \"Dwarf\" was nonplussed. He looked dejected; followed me to the door, took his place in the ranks and came in with his classmates, went to his seat and stared at me with wondering eyes. After attending to Jefferson, I took my seat at the desk and motioned to \"Dwarf\" to come to me. He came instantly and blurted out: \"Jeff told you I was chewing tobacco, didn't he?\" \"No, you were not mentioned. Jefferson was pleading with me to let him study my religion.\" \"Dwarf\" stood amazed. The bulldog had become a lamb. I continued in low tones: \"Suppose you were speaking to me of something of interest to you, and Jefferson entered the room and hit you in the jaw with all his strength, what ought I to do to Jefferson?\" \"Give him a sound thrashing to make him remember he made a fool of himself,\" he replied. \"I like your sense of justice,\" I remarked. \"Shall I get a switch?\" he asked. While he went out for something to have himself chastised, his brother John came to my desk. \"Sister, I'm afraid ‘Dwarf’ will do something unexpected, but I'll be at your side in one bounce.\" \"Thank you, but take your seat.\" \"Dwarf\" came in with a strong branch of cotton-wood tree. Without one word from me he gave me his right hand, then his left. Did he feel what I felt? I do not know. I hoped he would remain after morning session to have a little talk with me, but he did not, nor did he return this afternoon, from which I infer his school days are over, as far as this school is concerned. I intend to follow him up at his home and help his mother as best I can to make a better boy of him. Was this not using psychic knowledge to some purpose? February 19 This noon a number of the young men pupils came slowly into the school hall. The look on their faces puzzled me, so I walked to the front door. I ought to tell you, the road from the Convent to the end of the Public School building, one block, is used as a play-ground for the boys; the girls use the ground at the rear of the school. The look of the pupils made me fear some mischief was on hand. As soon as I reached the door facing the street, a man holding a child by each hand came toward me. \"Sister, I want to tell you, your pupils are not kind to my boys. I brought them here to play, and your pupils walked away.\" I felt sorry for the two poor innocent lads, so only said, \"Put at least a small shirt on each of them and bring them at playtime.\" The man's eyes and mouth opened wide, then he said, \"Ah, I see, I will put a camisa on them.\" February 23 Organized a Vigilant Club among the most earnest pupils. The object of this club is to report to me any case of distress in families or individuals. We are to have fun, too, but all leading to self-improvement. Clubs must have some object. This club is to meet conditions as we find them here, and improve them when possible. Oh, the immense field of work there is in this place! I've not mentioned the location of Trinidad and its consequent results. It is the rendezvous for the outlawed, who take to the Santa Fé Trail, and an equal protector for those who use the \"Statute of Limitation\" from the Territory of New Mexico. The boundary line between Colorado and New Mexico is just twelve miles from Trinidad. The spot is marked by a large stone, a few rods from which is the toll gate kept by Mr Dick Wooten, one of the first trappers of these regions. Mr Wooten's home is a refuge for all sorts of characters who can hold themselves in check while under his roof.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & S1019-D006 & 0.061 & 0.099 & 0.840 &  0.9981\\\\\n",
       "\t5 &  March 1, 1873. My Dear Sister Justina: It is some time since I jotted down anything in my journal. The fact is, so many incidents followed one another that it is difficult for me to note even the ones most out of the ordinary. To-day Sister Marcella and myself were at choir rehearsal when one of our native boys came in to say quite enthusiastically for a Mexican: \"Hay muchas hermanas y gentes.\" (There are many Sisters and people). And he added in English: \"And Bishop Salpointe, and priests, and mules, and wagons, all in the corral!\" This from the speaker who was anxious to have courtesy shown the travelers. Let me remark that every Spaniard or Mexican I've met has an innate refinement. Sister Marcella sent me to see to the travelers for, so we surmised, they were. When I got to the corral, I saw a medley crowd sure enough of holy men and women, and a very unholy sight of wagons, mules, and shabbily appareled, dusty and tired travelers. I took in the situation at a glance. Among the groups waiting some recognition I noticed a number of Sisters toward whom I made my way, and only succeeded in saying, \"You are welcome, Sisters,\" when one of them fairly lifted me off my feet. When she let me down, I raised my eyes to look at her she is quite tall wondering if I knew her. At first glance my wonder ceased. It was Sister Martha from the convent of my Kansas City adventure! The travelers remained with us five days. They were on their way to Arizona. Our Sisters here are, as elsewhere, most hospitable. What time I could give from my school work, I gave to our visitors. Three of these Sisters were at the Kansas City Convent, where, it will be recalled, by an accident to the train ahead of us, I had been obliged to stop off, and I had gone to their convent to await the arrival of the next train. From these Sisters I learned why I was suspected of being an impostor. A few weeks before my arrival, two men had made a wager. One man asserted that he could gain admittance to the convent after closing hour, the other positively denying that he could do so. The former, to prove his assertion, dressed in woman's clothes, applied to the convent for a night's lodging, \"I have no money, I am hungry, please give me something to eat and shelter for the night.\" The pseudo-woman was served supper, at which time the preconcerted signal was given in proof that he had gained entrance. He gave a shrill whistle and rushed from the Convent. The Sisters hardly had had time to get over their fright when I made my appearance. This accounts for the many questions put to me. Yet the unique part of the whole proceeding was that every question I answered was my own condemnation. \"Do your Sisters travel alone?\" \"No, Sister.\" \"Why are you alone?\" \"Because I was sent alone.\" \"Your letter of Obedience?\" \"I destroyed it before starting on this journey.\" Under these conditions, who would not have been suspicious of me, and who would not have taken the precaution to watch my every act? Sister Martha then told me that, with all appearances against me, the Sisters had been sympathetic. They had felt an uneasiness of mind during all the hours I was compelled to wait for the outgoing train. Good Friday, 1873. Sisters Marcella, Fidelis, and myself went to the Sierra one of the Rocky Mountain spurs to see the Penitentes make the \"Way to Calvary.\" About one hundred took part in it. They walked in twos, faces covered, backs bared. Each had several branches of long bruised cacti, with which they lashed their backs as they slowly ascended the spur. At each lash they said, \"Yo penitente pecador,\" (I, a repentant sinner.) When the one dragging the cross reached the summit of the spur, some of the penitentes helped to raise the cross he alone had dragged. It seemed impossible for any one man to have accomplished such an act, but we saw him do it. We were several miles from Trinidad and wanted to reach our convent home before the lighter of our globe threw his golden rays to warn us that he soon would retire. Easter Sunday, 1873. I must tell you what information I received concerning the Penitentes. The Way of the Cross, of course, was taught the natives by the good Franciscans; so also penance was preached to them. When the Franciscans were obliged to leave the Southwest, it naturally fell to the stronger-minded and piously inclined to perpetuate what had been taught them, but in this teaching each leader followed his own idea; hence, we find that whilst the members of some lodges are perfectly docile to the teachings of the Church, other lodges have not the least conception of the correct spirit of Catholicity, though they consider themselves good Catholics. The Penitentes in this vicinity do not even make their Easter duty. They do not scruple to abstract cattle from another man's ranch on the Easter Monday, after having scourged themselves on Good Friday and called themselves \"Repentant sinners.\" This reminds one of the private interpretation of the Bible. The Penitentes interpret the teaching of the Franciscans in their own way. The initiation to these lodges varies also. Here is one form: Ridges are made from neck to waist-line with sharp stones. By privilege I was allowed to visit one of their lodges it was literally bespattered with blood side, walls, and ceiling, too yet the members of the lodge I visited are adroit pilferers of any branded domestic animals seen on the plains. These same members never approach the Sacraments. They are condemned by the Church. Easter week Here is a tragedy which took place this week. An elderly lady and gentleman Americans residing a few miles from Trinidad, were found murdered in their home. Suspicion at once pointed to the natives as the perpetrators of the horrible deed. Small groups of men were sent out to capture the murderers. One posse trailed four Mexicans, and because they would not acknowledge the deed, were hanged on the first tree to which they came. Afterwards the corpses were huddled into a wagon, brought to Trinidad in triumph and thrown into an old vacant adobe hut, twelve feet from the graveyard near the Convent. Can you imagine how we felt! Two days later the real murderers were captured and confessed the crime. They were outlawed Americans! Rafael, Indian Chief of the Utes, is on the warpath because the government agents have repeatedly made his tribe \"move on.\" Poor Indians! Will they ever understand that the conquerors claim the land? How quickly the Indian detects true sympathy from the counterfeit! Feast of St Aloysius, 1873. The resident students were to have a free day and enjoy it on the mountains. The pastor's new white Maria (a white covered wagon) and traveling horses had been put at the Sisters' disposal. The driver that was to take the reins came at the last moment 9 o'clock A M, to say he found it impossible to go to the mountains for the day. The young ladies were woefully disappointed. Singularly for me, I did not offer to drive. Sister Marcella said: \"Sister Blandina, unless you take the young ladies to the mountains, they will have a second disappointment. Sister Eulalia can remain with them while you come back for the second load.\" So I started with the first load. The horses had been resting for two weeks and stable-fed during that time. They were horses accustomed to traveling forty or fifty miles a day to and from the various mission posts, consequently use horse sense when they start on their mission journey by not tiring themselves out at the start. When I had driven about six miles, we came to an enticing place to camp for the day. The young girls in great glee jumped to the ground. Keeping the youngest pupil to return with me, I reined the horses' heads toward Trinidad, when lo! I saw at once we had a runaway team. I recalled many horse traits so managed to guide and keep them on the road. Presently I saw our way lay through a very rough road where I had all I could do when driving out to keep clear of large boulders. So I tried my strength against the runaway horses. The reins were new and cut my hands to the bone. The atmosphere here is so clear one can see a great distance ahead, and I saw death if I kept on the road, so I gathered strength by will power and turned the horses to the left of the road on to level ground followed by a ravine. What happened I do not know, but when I awoke I saw the bus turned over, the horses grazing at a distance, the top of the bus about five rods from it, and no sign of my companion. I felt no pain, so I tried to raise the bus one ton needless to say, it did not budge. I began to search for my companion. I could see her nowhere. I went toward the white canopy of the wagon and there, under its shade, was Miss Chené, blood oozing from her nose and no sign of life. I raised her in my arms and said: \"Blessed Mother, you know I had no desire to come out here to-day. I did so through obedience. So, please, see to the life of this child, while I go for the horses.\" When I got to where the horses were grazing I picked up the reins, but horselike they understood they had the best of me, and though I said, \"Get up,\" they did not move; so I changed my system with all the energy I could and repeated, \"Get up!\" They trotted to the place of the upset bus where I tied them to one of the wheels and returned to where I had left my companion in apparent death. She was sitting up and greeted me by saying, \"Oh, Sister, there is blood all over your neck.\" Remember there was not a house in sight, nor any water. Guided by her voice, I wiped my neck and asked her if she could walk. She attempted to get up, but could not. I tried to raise her in order to carry her, but she was as heavy to me as a mountain. So we talked for a while, then attempted to walk to Trinidad. We had walked about half a mile when we saw a country wagon advancing toward us. We knew at once that whoever was in the wagon was coming to our relief. I felt no pain until I knew help was near. The instant I realized the situation, and that the burden would be shared by others, I simply collapsed. It was sheer exercise of will which prevented me from fainting. We were assisted into the wagon and started for Trinidad. On the last descent we met one of the best horsemen in these parts. He said he could see from his ranch that some accident had taken place, so he came with rope and hammer, etc, to be of some service. I remarked, \"As good a horseman as you are, you cannot trust that team.\" He smiled incredulously, but he had a runaway when he attempted to drive to town. He took a jockey's precaution tired the horses before he again turned their heads toward Trinidad. When the pastor met me, he remarked: \"I did not anticipate any trouble with you at the reins.\" I responded: \"Were I to drive that team again, I would surely tire it in sand before trusting it on any road.\" Within the next week, when the Rev gentleman was answering a sick call, the horses started on a gallop which he could not check. When the horses recognized they were the masters, they started at full speed. He was thrown out and was picked up wounded, and had to be brought into Trinidad in someone else's vehicle, leaving his own for repairs. When he came to the convent to have his wounds dressed, he remarked, \"Those horses gave me the surprise of my life no wonder, Sister, you could not hold them in.\" So St Aloysius day, 1873, will not soon be forgotten by me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   & S1019-D007 & 0.071 & 0.081 & 0.848 &  0.9670\\\\\n",
       "\t6 &  July, 1873. Dear Sister Justina: The last time I wrote in this journal I gave you an account of what occurred on St Aloysius day. All intervals of this journal are overcrowded with events not of daily occurrence in the United States. I will note incidents which intimately concern our life work. I've discovered that the wild lemetes make a nice syrup jelly, so we shall have syrup jelly next year added to our ordinary menu. Nearly every housewife in Trinidad has come to the convent to verify the syrup fact. August: Sister Eulalia and myself strolled up the Purgatoire River looking for wild flowers. We found plenty, and also a cluster of wild plum trees plums as delicious as any cultivated plums. The land is \"virgin\" and can be made to yield fruits and vegetables pleasing to the best of agriculturists. Another Indian scare is on. This will stop land-grabbers for a while. Here any dishonest man can become possessor of the acres he covets. It has repeatedly happened that when a land-grabber nails a small house on land acquired by spurious methods, and a grabber more greedy than himself claims this theft, the result is a fight, whoever kills the other, holds possession. Such disturbances are of frequent occurrence; they cause a sensation for a few days, then all is forgotten. But the Mexican cannot forget that all his earthly possessions have gone into the hands of strangers. Woe to the poor native if he attempts to retaliate! He has no rights that the invading fortune hunters feel obliged to respect. Many of our Mexicans hold lands by traditional possession of Mercedes (Grants) and believe they are secure. The land-sharper comes in and proves their claim is not legal. No matter that they have lived on the land for years, the Mexicans must \"vamoos,\" as these corrupters of the Spanish language say. Upon a less legal tenure than the one the Mexican was made to move, the grabber takes possession. The crisis comes when one despoiler is overreached by another artful shark who, during the dark hours of the night, removes the hastily constructed lumber shanty and replaces it by one of his own, having previously torn out any county records which could prove possession. At the dawn of the next day appear on the coveted land the violators of \"Thou shalt not steal,\" ready for what may happen. The usual outcome is that one rogue recognizes the other, and each knows he has but one chance for life, who will shoot first. The last of this series of crimes is: a disappointed, dejected, would-be-rich-quick man trying to drown his disappointment in aqua fortis. Just such a man straggling along the street saw one of our quiet, honest men coming toward him. Was it the sight of goodness that aroused his infernal hatred? Without a word he drew his revolver and shot him. The victim could only say, \"Lord, have mercy on me,\" and expired. This murder aroused the indignation of every citizen. Several men who witnessed the deed caught the murderer and held him till the sheriff came. A mob gathered, and in short time the murderer was condemned to be hanged to a tree near the river, in sight of my schoolroom! The sheriff sent a messenger to ask if I wished to speak to the criminal, with the hope of making him realize the gravity of his crime and that in a few minutes he was to answer to Almighty God for the life of an innocent man. I could not see that my going to the place of retribution would bring good results, consequently, I sent a member of our Vigilant Club to try to induce the criminal to make an act of contrition, but the poor man did not comprehend, or possibly did not wish to, for he said: \"I die game! This is not the first man I made eat the earth. I die game!\" No one except those that have witnessed such a scene can imagine its horror. The hanging was done in broad daylight and as orderly as a funeral train! I mentioned in the first pages of this journal that any prisoner can burrow out of our adobe jail, and since the circuit court comes only at long intervals, it happens that no criminals are ever put on the docket. I visit the jail regularly. And here is how I am able to do it: I offer to be chaperon to the young ladies of the Academy, as most of them love open air and take horse rides on the plains, and so it requires more than ordinary sights to shock or unnerve them. Hence, in our walks, I invariably visit the prisoners. It does both the prisoners and the young ladies good. Among the group that is very fond of fresh air is a Miss C . She has read books of the ex-nun type and the horrors of what they say takes place in Convents. Consequently, she is suspicious and watches the nuns closely. Last Sunday Miss C was so homesick she actually cried out loud. Sister Eulalia was \"Angel\" at the time, and came to ask me if I could not devise something to make Miss Annie forget her homesickness. I went at once to the recreation hall and found the girl sobbing. I said: \"Come, young ladies, let us take a stroll to Simpson's Rest.\" The seniors in my class have made a trail to the top of the \"Rest.\" Miss Annie brightened up at once and said: \"Yes, girls, let's go.\" We started. After crossing the little stream called a river, we had everything to ourselves. The canopy above the plain below, leading to the base of Simpson's Spur. Miss C asked why this spur of the Rockies was named Simpson's Rest. I was glad of anything that would divert her mind, so I narrated what Mr Simpson himself had told me. \"I went on the spur,\" Mr Simpson said, \"to get away from an attack of Indians. I wanted to draw their attention to me so that the few men and women in Trinidad would have time to make preparation for defense. The ruse succeeded, the squad of Indians followed me. I knew every inch of the land, and the shortest cut to the vantage spot, where I could snap off anyone coming to the top of the spur. Two Indians tried to come, and I shot each one in turn. The others of the group so I surmised would make me die of thirst. My provisions were giving out, but the Indians held to their purpose, possibly thinking if they got rid of me, they could make a raid on Trinidad. Meanwhile, the inhabitants had brought as much water as they could store, killed two steers and dried the meat in the sun. In fact, were prepared for a siege. But, apparently, I was the one wanted. Day after day passed. The besiegers did not attempt to ascend to the place of my captivity. I had to hoard my ammunition. I was getting unbearably thirsty when suddenly I recalled a natural cut on the left of the spur where the snow never disappears. Under cover of night. I cautiously crawled to the place and found plenty of snow. I ate all I needed and took a lump with me to my hiding place. I repeated my visit to the cut for more snow. Having something to drink, I knew I could hold out indefinitely. \"At the end of a week the Indians gave the war whoop, no doubt, thinking I was dead. I felt they would climb the mountain for my scalp. Two of the most agile ran ahead of the others. I shot one and reloaded for the other, but he ran out of sight. I was worn out, for I only napped during the day and kept wide awake at night, knowing the warfare methods of the Indians. At the end of the second week I saw my besiegers gallop away, but I did not trust myself to go down to Trinidad. The watchers in Trinidad saw them depart and knew I was alive, because the Indians gave no war whoop, nor showed any scalp. So they dispatched three runners to bring me something to eat and some strong coffee. I saw them coming, and began to descend. When we met, they told me the Indians had made one raid, but were met with such a volley of shots that they did not attempt a second attack.\" George Simpson was a young man from the East. He came West as an adventurer, and became a pioneer hunter and trapper. He married a beautiful Mexican girl, Juanita, and made his home near Trinidad. The following poem written by himself some time after this adventure with the Indians, refers to her as \"one mourner\": SIMPSON'S REST Lay me to rest on you towering height, Where the silent cloud-shadows glide, Where solitude holds its slumberous reign, Far away from the human tide. I fain would sleep near the old pine tree, That looks down on the valley below, Like a soldier guarding a comrade's grave, Or a sentinel watching a foe. 'Twas a refuge once in the bygone time, When a pitiful fate was near, When my days were young and full of love For a life I held too dear. Thro' all the long years that have passed away Since those nights of storm and dread, I've prayed that the boughs that sheltered me then Might wave o'er my breast when dead. Delve deep my grave in the stern gray rock In its rigid embrace let me rest, With naught but my name on the stone And the symbol of Faith on my breast. One mourner perhaps may remember where sleeps In the rock-ribbed tomb, the lone dead, May breathe for the loved one to Heaven, a prayer, A tear to his memory shed. By the time I had narrated what had been told me, we had ascended one-half of the spur. Then Miss Annie and another girl sprang to the front and were following the trial, telling us they were not afraid of mountain cats or any other animal. \"We are ready for any adventure,\" they said. They continued following the trail until they came to a curved projection which hid me from the view of anyone coming in the opposite direction. We had been walking briskly, so no one felt like talking. The two young ladies stopped at the projection. When we reached the curve we heard men's voices. By this time I could see the quizzically amused expression on the faces of the young ladies. Meanwhile the men were saying all sorts of things to the girls while walking toward them, not suspecting the presence of anyone else. As they neared them the girls stepped backward toward us and I went in front of all my protegés. What followed was so comical, that Miss C and her companion had to sit down on the trial to get over their convulsive laughter. The instant the two (what shall I name them?) saw me, they both gave one spring toward the descent, which on their side had no trail. Realizing the law of gravity, I hid my face, believing I would have to notify their friends of their sudden death in their attempt to descend the steep side of Simpson's Rest. The laughter of the girls made me look to where the men had gone down. They had reached the bottom without injury. As soon as Miss C could speak, she changed laughter into seriousness and said: \"I want a catechism, and I want to become a Catholic. Maria Monk and Edith O'Gorman may talk and have books published against Convents but what I saw this afternoon has counteracted all I have ever read derogatory to convents and Sisters.\" Shall I add the two men came early the next day to make an apology? What does this signify? They were afraid to lose the trade of the Convent!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 & S1019-D008 & 0.144 & 0.083 & 0.773 & -0.9993\\\\\n",

       "| 1 |  TRINIDAD On Train from Steubenville, Ohio, to Cincinnati. Nov 30, 1872. My Darling Sister Justina: How interestedly you, Sister M Louis and myself read Eugénie de Guérin's Journal and her daily anxieties to save her brother from being a spiritual outcast! This Journal which I propose keeping for you will deal with incidents occurring on my journey to Trinidad and happenings in that far-off land to which I am consigned. The Journal will begin with the first act. Here is Mother Josephine's letter: Mt St Vincent, O, Nov 27, 1872. Sister Blandina, Steubenville, O My Dear Child: You are missioned to Trinidad. You will leave Cincinnati Wednesday and alone. Mother Regina will attend to your needs. Devotedly, Mother Josephine. This letter thrilled us both. I was delighted to make the sacrifice, and you were hiding your feelings that I might not lose any merit. Neither of us could find Trinidad on the map except in the island of Cuba. So we concluded that Cuba was my destination. I was to leave Steubenville quietly so that none of my obstreperous pupils might cause the incoming teacher annoyance. Hence I went to Sunday catechetical class as usual 2:00 P M I was to take the 3:00 P M train for Cincinnati. I said to my hopefuls, \"Instead of catechism, I'm going to tell you an Indian story to-day.\" The schoolhouse roof was not disturbed, though the hurrahs were loud enough! The moral of the story was \"Indian Endurance.\" Dismissed them at two-thirty without one word of goodbye except the daily one. You remember how surprised I was to see a crowd at the station to wish me \"Godspeed\"; I thought I was to slip away without anyone's knowledge except our own. Mr Tait and Mr McCann wished to speak to me alone. Both had been in the West. \"You will have a long travel on the plains,\" they said, \"before you reach Trinidad.\" \"Where is Trinidad?\" \"A little mining town in Southwestern Colorado.\" So then I knew my destination, which, of course I would have been told at Mt St Vincent. Both gentlemen said they had traveled on the plains on the Santa Fe Trail, and they seemed to have made it a matter of conscience to inform me on the subject of cowboys. This in substance was their conversation with me: \"Sister, you may be snow-bound while on the plains.\" I looked my assent, I knew I could not stop the snow. \"Travelers are sometimes snow-bound for two weeks, and you are alone. This, though, is not the greatest danger to you.\" Mentally I was wishing both gentlemen somewhere else. \"Your real danger is from cowboys.\" I looked at the speakers. \"You do not seem to grasp our meaning. No virtuous woman is safe near a cowboy.\" Both gave up trying to make me understand what they considered danger. Why should snow or cowboys frighten me any more than others who will be traveling the same way! So you see, dearest, I'm not going to so long a distance as we thought. At three o'clock A M the baggage checker came through our coach. I looked to see how much the pocketbook contained just twenty-five cents. If I used it to ride to the Good Samaritan I'd be minus the fare to Mt St Vincent, so I made up my mind to skirt around from the Little Miami to the Good Samaritan Hospital. At four A M I rang the front doorbell no response. I sat on the stone steps and waited till I heard the rising bell, then I waited another fifteen minutes when again I rang the doorbell. Sister Anthony came. \"Why, child, where did you come from; how did you get here? I'm sure you are cold.\" I said I came from Steubenville. \"Oh, yes! dear Father Bigelow died there. He was good to this hospital. Last year he sent a barge of coal to us.\" I said he was good to anyone in need. He died possessed of three dollars and fifty cents. His hand was always open to any kind of distress. I did not mention to Sister Anthony that I walked from the Little Miami Station. After Mass, breakfast and miles of sympathy and \"God Bless You\" from the Sisters at the Good Samaritan, one of the nurses accompanied me to Fifth and Vine Streets, where I was to take \"Barney's Bus\" for Mt St Vincent. The bus was to leave at ten A M I waited till three P M then asked one of the clerks if he thought Mr McCabe would run the bus that day. \"I fear no bus will run to-day. There is an epidemic epizootic among the horses.\" I asked if Mr Segale's place of business was anywhere near. He pointed to Wood's Theater and I started to the place indicated. Brother Henry managed to find a \"hack\" to send me to Mt St Vincent. On the way, between the first ascent of the hill and the Seminary, I met Sisters Gabriella and Delphina walking in the slush and cold on their way to the Orphan Asylum. I stopped to take them in. They returned with me to Cedar Grove, from there the driver was to take them to the Asylum in Cumminsville. Sister Gabriella said to me, \"I would gladly go where you are going instead of shouldering this heavy burden.\" Sister is to be mother to three hundred orphans, taking Sister Sophia's place. The Sisters are showing great sympathy. I heard Sister Benedicta say, \"She does not mind going so far and alone I've not seen her shed a tear.\" Nor will you, my dear Sister. The tears will flow where none but He and myself will know. Still, I'm delighted to go. I did not tell you, dearest, that one year ago last November I wrote to Mother Regina saying I envied the sacrifices the Sisters were making who were sent far away to do God's work. I've received my answer with compound interest. You know that up to date the Sisters going on distant missions were consulted and none were sent who had parents living. I am pleased that that record is broken in my case. Mother Regina told me to spend a day at home. Dear Lord! Give me strength. I anticipate a scene. I spent Wednesday, December 5th, at our old homestead. Mother kept open house all day. Friends came in groups. Mr Leverone and bride, his mother and the bride's mother, Mrs Garibaldi, the Misses Gardelli and a host of others. Mrs Garibaldi threatened to take off my habit. I said, \"Hands off! Have you any right to detain Mary if John wishes to take her to California?\" \"Oh, that is different.\" \"Yes, as different as heaven and earth. I have chosen my portion, Mary has chosen hers, each abides by her choice.\" John Leverone's mother acted most sensibly all day. She was soothing oil to all the protests made to my going. Our dear mother kept quiet. When we were permitted a lone interview she asked, \"Do you want one of your sisters to accompany you?\" I answered, \"I prefer to do just as my superiors have told me.\" \"Well, then I will give you a thousand-dollar check so that in case you desire to return you will have the wherewith.\" \"No, no, dear mother, I fully realize the responsibilities I assumed. As you are aware, I realized them from the first day I entered the Novitiate.\" Mother replied: \"And I want to tell you I never doubted your vocation. I agree to your sacrifice, my dear child, keep on serving God, I will never interfere. Now that I have your explicit answer, friends cannot urge any logical reason to prevent your going.\" All day the visitors reminded me of a disturbed ant hill. When mother and I were alone she spoke the Genoese dialect. It was like hearing sketches of a favorite opera. Wednesday at 2:00 P M I went to visit our Ecclesiastical Superior. The Most Rev J B Purcell offered me several gifts. But St Francis Xavier is my patron, so I'm not going to possess any superfluous article, I only regret I could not pass our home without going in, as St Francis Xavier did. If I aim high I surely must reach some upper strata of detachment in His service. One thing I take with me, the impressive blessing given me by His Grace, part of which rings clear \"May angels guard your every step.\" He was extremely sympathetic at my having to go alone. I went to confession to Rev Dr Callaghan. You may recall how we enjoyed his lecture on the \"School Question\" delivered in Steubenville. After mother had a short interview with me, father managed to see me alone. He took hold of me and asked, \"Have I ever denied you anything?\" I signified no. \"You have never disobeyed me in your life?\" I assented. \"Now I command you you must not go on this far away mission! Are you going?\" \"Yes, father.\" He let go the hold on my arm and walked toward the door. Not without my seeing his tears falling fast. He did not realize his hold on my arm gave me pain not to speak of the heart-pain for him. In the railway station at St Louis between train time, I got off to purchase a pair of arctics. I saw several Italian women selling fruit. One of them had a daughter standing near. I asked the mother if she would permit her daughter to accompany me to the shoe store, which was in sight. The mother looked at me earnestly then said to her neighbor peddler, \"How do I know who she is, she looks like a monica (sister) but she might be a strega (witch).\" I thanked the true guardian of her daughter and went to make my purchase alone. I spoke English to the peddler. If good Sister Benedicta who thought I did not mind because I did not cry had seen me during the greater part of last night she would but too truly have said, \"That heart is human in every fiber.\" That I succeeded in dignifiedly getting away from home is Thy Grace, oh, my God! Forty-two persons accompanied me to the train, among them friends of old, but my purpose never faltered, not even in shadow. Such tactics as I executed yesterday! I see one trait strong in me, the straight service of God. Not the father whom I had never seen cry, nor the most patient, dearest mother whose heart is crushed at my being sent alone, much less the friends who used every argument to make me say I would not go could elicit the faintest trace that I was not more pleased at my going alone than if I had had a dozen with me. Sisters Antonia and Gonzaga came to the waiting room. I asked the company to permit me an interview with the Sisters. When going toward them, one of my dear old friends said, \"Look, we cannot doubt she is happy.\" This was not intended for my hearing, the noise caused the speaker to raise her voice. Sister Antonia asked me how I had spent the day. I narrated some incidents. \"I'm an ancient religious, but I could not have gone through the ordeal as creditably as you did.\" What if I had mentioned all the heart sighs I had witnessed! When it was time to board the train I asked that my last interview be with my mother. Cannot you picture her sad, endearing look of appreciation? I'll skip the last talk with mother some of it was in silence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | S1019-D002 | 0.051 | 0.131 | 0.818 |  0.9994 |\n",
       "| 2 |  Kansas City, Dec 6, 1872. Number one! Number two! Number three! I went toward omnibus number three. \"Any convent in this city?\" I asked. \"Yes, ma'am, step in.\" When the bus drove on the convent avenue, I saw the whole place was lighted up. I rang the doorbell and it was answered instantly. I said to the Sisters, \"Did you expect me?\" \"No, Sister.\" \"How, then, did you respond so quickly?\" \"We expected a Sister on this train. We are staying up with a dead Sister who will be buried tomorrow. In your case it is fortunate the Sister did not come you can occupy the room prepared for her the only spare room in the convent.\" Previous to this explanation, I had quickly reasoned: Superiors at home watched the papers saw the railroad accident wired the convent the result being the illumination and Sisters waiting. It did not occur to me that there might be more than one convent in Kansas City. The next turn of affairs brought me to the reality of my position. The two Sisters who had opened the door went to report the non-appearance of the one expected and my coming. Presently the Sisters returned, but their countenances had a dejected look. I became apprehensive at once and asked: \"What is it, Sisters?\" \"Our Superior wants to know if it is customary for your Sisters to travel alone?\" said one. \"No, Sister, it is not.\" \"Have you your letter of obedience?\" \"I destroyed it before starting on this journey. I have no credentials to show except the name on my wearing apparel.\" \"Why are you traveling alone?\" \"Because I was sent alone.\" With this explanation they left me to make a second report. When they returned they were more dejected than before. The elder of the two Sisters spoke: \"Sister, our Superior thinks you had better go to some hotel.\" \"Sisters, I have been well provided for my journey, but I cannot set people thinking by leaving the hospitality of a convent to seek shelter in some hotel. I clearly see I'm considered some sort of a fake, however, if you will kindly let me rest on that sofa, you can allay your fears by locking the door and taking the key with you.\" They went to make a third report. When they returned it was a pleasure to see their cheerful faces. One spoke, \"No, Sister, we are going to prepare a lunch for you.\" \"Please do not. This is the First Friday of the month and a Holy Communion day for me.\" The last vestige of doubt and fear disappeared from their countenances. A pillow and comfort were placed on the sofa and bidding me good rest, they locked the door, taking the key with them. At six o'clock A M, I was shown to the chapel. After Mass I noticed some hesistancy as how to proceed with me. Would they leave me in the convent, or have me join in the funeral procession to their graveyard? Presently I felt a light thump at the left of the priedieu on which I knelt. I looked and saw a hand holding a candle for me to take I understood I was to fall in line. After the funeral, breakfast was served me in the same room in which I had rested. About ten o'clock A M, the Superior came to interview me. I saw the handwriting on the wall, I was an impostress. Had time from interview until three o'clock to myself. During this interval I wrote. Among the jottings I wrote a letter to dear Sister Gabriella, telling her I was in a religious convent at Kansas City, but was considered some one in disguise. I told her I was glad it was I instead of Sister Justina, because her sensitiveness would make her suffer intensely. I am taking the whole incident as some of the many things that may happen to me on my journey to the Southwest. At three o'clock P M, I asked for a companion to accompany me to order the omnibus for the midnight train. After placing my order, I turned to the clerk and said, \"Be sure to send the bus.\" When I reached the exit door I returned to where the clerk was standing, and said, \"It is absolutely necessary for me to take the outgoing midnight train. Under no consideration neglect to have the omnibus come for me.\" He assured me again the order was properly placed and would be attended to. The train that brought me from St Louis had been delayed two hours, owing to the accident which had occured to the train ahead of ours. There is only one daily (nightly) train from this place to the terminus of the road. Dinner and supper were served me as breakfast had been. I am hoping that some of the Sisters will come in to relieve my mind and tell me what speices of a scarecrow I am thought to be. It is seven o'clock no one has come in so far some one now. \"You poor child! What must you think of us and the spirit of this convent?\" I did not have time to answer, for a voice called, \"Sister Martha!\" Sister Martha grasped her lighted candle and briskly followed the voice. I mentally observed that we would not carry a lighted candle through corridors and rooms. However, I have enough to think about without letting fire insurance policies annoy me. The room is dark, a reflection from a lamp-post in the street throws a small stream of light in one window. I still have fully four hours before the bus calls for me. \"Angels guard your every step.\" I'm going to rest on the sofa. I heard a voice, \"Sister?\" I sat erect. \"Mother wants to know if you are sure you ordered the bus?\" Was it my want of rest or injured feeling of pride which was on the verge of giving vent to my thoughts? From the gleam of light that came from the lamp-post I noticed that the speaker was a novice. \"Surely, Sister Blandina, you will not scandalize an aspirant in His service!\" While silently speaking thus to myself I looked at the young novice. She had a good placid face, and I said, \"Sister, please say to your Superior that I surely ordered the bus.\" She bowed and left me. Now, dearest Sister Justina, if by some unthinkable reason the omnibus does not come for me, I am positively certain the police will! \"Angels guard your every step.\" How happy I am that you, dear, are not in this predicament. I am arranging my speech to the policeman. I hear him say, \"The nuns sent for me to show you the way to any hotel you wish to go to!\" and I shall say, \"I do not wish to go to any hotel. Be kind enough to wire to the Most Rev J B Purcell, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for any information you desire about me.\" I see a note of intelligence appear on his countenance while he critically studies me but through it all I cannot see myself going to any hotel. Though the suspense of not knowing what may happen makes me uneasy. Twenty minutes after eleven I hear the patter of horses' hoofs on the convent avenue. Deo Gratias. When I realized the omnibus had come for me, I put on my wraps and with my traveling black basket walked toward the door. It was opened by a Sister in the hall. Then it was I noticed this Sister had performed the work of a sentinel, guarding me! My impulse was to brush by her and into the bus. But telepathy worked quicker than impulse. Right reason was on their side. Instant remembrance recalled the fact that a few months previous I was given charge of two dressed as Franciscan Sisters and who were making a collection in Steubenville. I was to attend to them and they were not to associate with the Sisters. The day which was to be their last with us, and when they were on their way to the station to leave the town, a policeman tapped one of the two and said, \"Both of you come with me.\" The guardian of the law had seen a big foot encased in a boot. One was a man, the other his wife, who personified Franciscan Sisters. So instead of acting by impulse, I said: \"Please, Sister, say a fervent prayer that I may reach my destination in safety.\" I saw a glistening tear of sympathy. Was I not reaping reward for suppressing a hasty impulse? Nothing noticeable took place from the time the train left Kansas City until we reached the terminus of the railroad. A few scattered frame houses and the place is called Coolage. (I am spelling this name phonetically). A train was being made up of constructive material and at the end of the train I saw a very shabby coach from the windows of which a number of men were craning their necks looking at me. Gazing in every direction, I finally saw the train conductor. I went toward him and asked if I might board the made-up train for Kit Carson. He said: \"To-morrow we will put on a day coach; this is only a construction train carrying construction material and a crowd of Irish workmen to Kit Carson.\" \"Any objection to my going with them?\" \"Not if you can put up with a working man's ‘smoker.’\" I went toward the train. The conductor assisted me into the coach. The instant the Irishmen saw a Sister their hats came off and pipes were taken out of their mouths. When seated, I said to the two men in front of me: \"Please say to these good men that I am very fond of smoke from a pipe.\" The men replaced their hats and resumed their smoking. I doubt which side was more pleased they, to have me, or I to be with them. We reached Kit Carson shortly after midnight. When \"End of Construction line\" was called, one of the men stepped over to me and offered to carry my basket. I handed it to him; then, a gentleman bowed and gave me a letter. The one who had my basket waited to see what would happen. I read the letter and saw by its contents I was to follow the giver of the letter. Thanking the courtesy of the first man I let myself be guided by the second. This was Mr Mullen, an agent of Otero and Seller, the greatest commission firm of the Southwest. The loaded caravans of this firm are constantly on the Santa Fe Trail. My instructions from Mother Regina are: \"Wait in Kit Carson until the Sisters from Trinidad come for you.\" The letter handed me is from Sister Marcella, in charge of the Trinidad School Mission. It says, \"Take the stage and come on to Trinidad.\" Kit Carson, Colorado, Dec 8, 1872 This is the feast of the Immaculate Conception, and the anniversary of making our vows. I wonder what you are doing, dear Sister Justina, while I am trying to solve the problem of either going or staying here to-day. The facts are these: Had I not been compelled to wait over twenty-two hours in Kansas City, I should have arrived here in time to take the stage that would have brought me into Trinidad on the morning of the Feast of the Immaculata. Mother Regina's instruction ceases with the new order. Only exceptionally do we travel on Sundays and feast days of obligation, so I will order the stage for to-morrow and begin a little catechetical missionary work to-day. No better feast could inaugurate my new life. When I said Grace before breakfast, I noticed how gravely the junior Mullen looked at me; which gives me the best guarantee he hasn't been taught his prayers. I asked Mrs Mullen if she had any objection to my taking James on the plains to watch the habits of the prairie dogs. She said, \"I am glad to have him go, but prairie dogs have queer habits, they cannot be caught unless they are cornered in a place where they have no burrows.\" So Jamie and myself started to watch the prairie dogs. The little midgets remained on their artificial mounds until we got quite near them, then barked their peculiar baby bark, when, with a still more singular wheezy bark, turned and bounded into their subterranean houses. Shall we ever learn the language of the lower animals! It was very plain we could not catch any of the little creatures, so I turned my attention to my young companion. \"Can you bless yourself?\" \"Like you did at breakfast?\" \"Exactly.\" \"Daddy said I ought to know how to do what you did.\" \"Shall I teach you?\" \"Oh! good, I will surprise daddy!\" I began with the Sign of the Cross. He learned quickly. I repeated the first part of the Lord's Prayer by periods many times. Then played catcher and tried again to run down a prairie dog. The little fellow was more anxious to learn than to play; which pleased me very much. By the time we went in to dinner, he had passably memorized the Lord's Prayer, Hail Mary and Grace before and after meals, so at dinner he silently said Grace with me. Mrs Mullen told me that three ladies had called to see me and would return this afternoon. We had buffalo meat for dinner. While on the train from Coolage (Colidge) to Kit Carson we saw a herd of buffalo. The herd was on a stampede. The brutes did look crazy; plainly, whatever direction they made for, nothing could stop them. Someone on the train remarked that it was surprising to see a herd of buffalo, as Kit Carson and Dick Wooten (both frontier trappers) had declared there were no more buffalo in herds. One might see a small group here and there on the plains, but a herd of buffalo was out of the question. Yet we saw one. The three ladies called again. They were anxious to be sympathetic at my traveling alone and so young! But they soon convinced themselves I needed no sympathy in my prospective workThe stage will call for me in the morning. I was told I am the only passenger booked for to-morrow. Mrs Mullen is having clean hay ready to put in the coach. I expected there would be others in the stagecoach with me. \"Angels guard your footsteps.\"  | S1019-D004 | 0.055 | 0.111 | 0.834 |  0.9993 |\n",
       "| 3 |  Trinidad, December 10, 1872. My dearest dear: Here I am safe in Trinidad, Colorado Territory, instead of in the island of Cuba where we first thought I was to go. No wonder this small pebble (Trinidad, Colo) is not on our maps. \"Angels guide your footsteps.\" This sentence has stayed with me from the time I left the Archbishop's residence in Cincinnati, and is with me still. In Kit Carson I ordered the stage for the morning of the 9th Mrs Mullen was very attentive. She had new clean hay put in the stage to keep my feet warm, and after I got in she wrapped a large comfort around me, remarking that \"traveling on the plains and in winter was not a pleasant prospect.\" The driver must have had strict injunctions from Otero and Seller they own the stage line. For the first time I had indefinable fears. The cowboys were constantly in my mind. I expected there would be a number traveling with me on the plains. \"Snow-bound and cowboys\" came in thought to annoy me. At noon the driver came to the stage door and said: \"We take dinner here.\" I thanked him and said: \"I do not wish any dinner.\" \"But, lady, we will not have another stopping place to eat until six o'clock this evening.\" I thanked him again, \"but I do not wish any dinner.\" The jolting of the stage and my thoughts had taken all appetite away. Though I could see nothing from the stage, (every flap was fastened) it seemed that the driver aimed to drive over every stone and make the wheels go into every rut. It was nothing but a jerk up and down all the way in a stage that had no springs and traveling at the rate of twelve miles an hour! At six o'clock we arrived at the station for supper. At every station the mules were changed. The driver came to ask me to supper. I thanked him, but said: \"I do not wish any supper.\" \"There will not be another chance for a meal until twelve o'clock to-night, and you have not tasted anything to-day, so come now and take it if only a cup of black coffee.\" \"No, thank you, I have no desire for anything.\" The poor man was quite distressed. He could not think I was trying to save traveling expenses, because the price of stage traveling included meals. Here is the mental attitude I was in: If the driver could surmise the vague fear that is preying on me he would know I have no appetite. He went in to supper and presently returned. \"Lady, if you do not want to eat come in and let me have my supper. The woman who runs this station will not give me a drink of muddy water unless I fetch you in to supper I told her how you are dressed and she goes off wild and says: ‘Bring her in or you will get nothing to eat to-night, nor any other time you come.’\" I went into an adobe, log-raftered, mud-floored, mud-plastered hut. The sight of the red checkered table cloth and black coffee only added to my repugnance for food. The person who kept the station was an Irish woman of the good old stamp. I made an effort to sip some coffee, but not a drop would pass my lips. The cowboys were in my mind. I tried to ascertain if there were any in the vicinity, the answers I received were indefinite. At midnight: \"Now, lady, you will have a good meal.\" \"No, thank you, I desire nothing.\" \"What will Otero and Seller say to me when they find out you did not take a meal during this journey? They gave me more orders about you than I ever got since I'm staging, and that's ten years.\" \"Say I wished for nothing. I will write the firm my thanks.\" Oh, the lonely, fearful feeling! The night was dark. No passengers to allay my turbulent thoughts. Foot-steps drew near the stage. My heart was thumping. The driver opened the stage door and said: \"You will have a traveling companion for some miles.\" In the open door, by the light of the lantern, I saw a tall, lanky, hoosier-like man, wearing a broad brimmed hat. On one arm he had a buffalo robe. While I sat riveted, he got in asked me if I would take part of his \"kivver,\" and before my fright permitted me to speak, he placed part of the buffalo robe over the comfort that enwrapped me, and sat beside me on the rear seat. The driver closed the door and we were in utter darkness. By descriptions I had read I knew he was a cowboy! With crushing vividness \"No virtuous woman is safe near a cowboy\" came to me. I made an act of contrition concentrated my thoughts on the presence of God thought of the Archbishop's blessing, \"Angels guard your steps,\" and moved to such position as would put my heart in range with his revolver. I expected he would speak I answer he fire. The agony endured cannot be written. The silence and suspense unimaginable. Suddenly from out the darkness I heard: \"Madam!\" \"Sir!\" \"What kind of a lady be you?\" \"A Sister of Charity.\" \"Whose sister?\" \"Everyone's Sister, a person who gives her life to do good to others.\" \"Quaker like, I reckon?\" \"No, not quite.\" By this time I learned from his tone of voice that I had nothing to fear. He asked me a number of questions, all prompted by a conversation he had had with the driver before he came into the stage. In my turn I asked him why he became a cowboy. He said he had read of cowboys and ran away from home to become one. \"Is your mother still living?\" \"Yes, I allow she is leastwise she was when I left home six years ago. \"Have you written to her?\" \"No, madam, and I allow that's beastly.\" \"It is certainly unkind to one whom you can always trust and who, I am sure, loves you as much now as she did when you were a little fellow.\" His voice got husky. \"What do you say I otter do?\" \"Write; do so as soon as you get off this stage. Tell her you will soon make her a visit, and see to it that you keep your word.\" \"I will, so help me God! I was mighty feared to speak to you when I got in, because the mule driver said you was more particular than any lady he ever seen. I allow I am powerful glad I spoke to you.\" To think that this lubberly, good-natured cowboy had made me undergo such mortal anguish. He got off on the outskirts of Trinidad where the driver stopped to point out to me dugouts at the side of the foothills. \"This, lady, is Trinidad.\" A fainting feeling came over me as I looked at what I would have thought were kennels for dogs. Then I remembered my perfect health, the many years in the order of nature, before my call would come. While these thoughts were dominating, bright and vivid came to my vision the life of St Francis Xavier, farther away, in a more desolate country, with less companions, and yet who did more for God? Though I know the driver continued to talk, I do not recall a word he said. There on the outskirts facing the dugouts of Trinidad I took St Francis Xavier as my model in the missionary life. The stage stopped to throw off the mail. While so doing, a gentleman, wearing a Roman collar and having a clerical look, came to the stage door and said: \"Ya, ya, Sister, come out. This is the Convent,\" pointing to a store, which, at a glance I could see was being used for post-office and general store. He made a motion to help me out. I put my hands in my habit sleeves and sat upright in the stage, acknowledging his proffered courtesy by \"Thank you, I'll stay here.\" The gentleman's eyes twinkled merrily and he walked briskly away. A few minutes after the driver came out, took the reins and drove off. Another stopping place. The driver opened the door and said: \"Here we are.\" Before making any attempt to leave the stage, I looked at the house and in the recess of the door saw two of our Sisters. I thought, this is more like it, and was helped in by Sisters Marcella and Fidelis. The gentleman who had come to the stage door is the parish priest who wanted to see as he expressed it \"what kind of a Sister is she who was sent across the plains alone.\" He wanted to give an agreeable surprise by playing a joke. Before the stage reached the convent, he managed to say to the Sisters: \"You cannot play jokes on her.\" To-day is Mother Regina's birthday, and my first day West. I will continue this journal and some years hence send it to you, dear Sister Justina. I'm not to go in school until the 6th of January, 1873. I began to review my Spanish. Rev P J Munnecum, the parish priest, is the teacher. To my surprise, the Sisters do not speak Spanish. My previous study of the language is a great help to me and has created a desire in the Sisters to study the language also. December 14, 1872 I am sure, dearest Sister Justina, you will be interested in my viewpoint of things as I find them here. To-day I went to look at my schoolroom to be; 40 ft long; 14 ft wide; 8 ft high; two small windows, lowsized door, no transom; solid adobe walls on two sides, log rafters as black as ebony. Of necessity ventilation said \"Goodbye\" when the house was completed. But I must add all these adobe houses were built with a view to protect the inhabitants in case of a sudden attack from the warring Indians. That does not mean that every house has these dimensions. The head of each family built to suit his taste in the matter of length, breadth, and height but material to date is unchangeable: sunburnt mud (shaped, of course) 4×9×18 inches; the foundation the same as walls, mud roof over rafters mud floors. There are some seventyfive of these houses on \"Mexican Hill.\" That will be my first objective point; the second will be the jail. The Purgatoire River corrupted into Picatwar, but the natives kept its correct name, Purgatorio is below the acequia, (artificial canal) which is the boundary line to land and house given by Mr Filippe Baca, one of the leading citizens here, to the Sisters for a school. The land on which the Academy is built (now in course of erection) was donated by a Mr Heone, who lives a few miles outside of Trinidad. This gentleman and Dr Beshoar, our physician, have pews in the church if you can call eight planks nailed together, pews. The Sisters use the choir loft. The church is an adobe structure with a pretense of a gable roof and a double pretense of having been shingled; mud floor, mud walls, wooden candlesticks. Previous to the Sisters coming, bottles were used for candlesticks. The only restful spot about the church are the grounds to the entrance of it. The graveyard is in the rear of the church with a street between graveyard and convent. There is a long stretch of an adobe wall from convent (academy) to public school, the only one here and taught by the Sisters. I am told there is an Academy (called \"Rice\") maintained by the Methodists. We have twelve resident young ladies at the Academy, occupying the part that is built; very few in the select school. The Sisters are: Sister Marcella, in charge and music teacher; Sister Martha, Housekeeper; Sister Eulalia, Factotum; Sister Fidelis, Select School; Sister Blandina, Public School Teacher; Sister Eulalia, Assistant. Here is the Trinidad of today: Commercial Street, a few scattered houses the length of two blocks. Main Street, a few scattered stores occupying one side of the street about the same length as Commercial Street. Convent Street, we use to the end of the Public School grounds, where there are a few small adobe huts. So far, Mr Baca has the only house that looks like a residence. Then there is the Mexican settlement on the hill. I am informed that very few prisoners ever come to trial. They manage to burrow out from jail before the Circuit Court convenes. The Circuit Court comes from Denver. Here, if you have a largeness of vision, you find the opportunity to exercise it; if a cramped one, the immense expanse of the plains, the solid Rockies, the purity of the atmosphere, the faultlessness of the canopy above, will stretch the mind toward the Good. Maybe, dearest, it may please you to know my own attitude at the present writing. Vede mio cuore. (Look at my heart). I wish I had many hands and feet, and a world full of hearts to place at the service of the Eternal. So much one sees to be done, and so few to do it. I have adopted this plan: Do whatever presents itself, and never omit anything because of hardship or repugnance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | S1019-D005 | 0.056 | 0.101 | 0.843 |  0.9987 |\n",
       "| 4 |  December 21. Rumor is loud in predicting an attack from the Ute tribe. We have a girl at the Academy named Ida Chené, whose mother gave me a vivid account of a sudden attack from one of the roving wild Indian tribes. The purpose of the attack was to drive out all who were not Mexicans this tribe had allied itself with the Mexicans. The outbreak took place near Taos. Mrs Chené was in the field plowing when the macheté was raised over her head and she was asked to pronounce the word juangoche. She did so to the satisfaction of the attacking group, who galloped away either to cleave or scalp the next who could not pronounce the word correctly. It is singular that not any of these things can cause me to fear. We have our own chapel. Very few Catholic Americans in Trinidad. The Church on Sunday is crowded by our native population, who come from many directions. Vehicles of every description bring the devout. Not a native woman wears any other covering on head except a mantella or shawl, and they kneel on the bare floor, and, let me add, they know how to pray and do it. In our well-to-do churches East, to secure musical harmony, professors and trained singers are engaged; in the congregations of mediocre wealth, the best talent give their service, attend rehearsals and sing when required. Yet in both elements there is a constant friction, if not always expressed, a felt dissatisfaction, and it is frequently a subject of annoyance to the Catholic conscience as to whether or not the duty of assisting at Mass is complied with by the choir attendants. The congregation, from youth to age, is ever ready to criticise the director, organist, individual singers, and choir. In the combined action of choir and congregation, how much intrinsic honor is rendered to God! He, alone, is the Judge. Now bring your attention to a close view of a scene in this church. The performers are two greyhaired men, each holding a large violin. The instrument reclines against the left knee, which is in position to rise when the signal is given that Mass has begun; right knee bent to the ground, eyes closed and head inclined. The priest begins, Et introibo, etc The violin players, with voice and instrument, strike off a half-singing, half reciting Kyrie, etc The violins seldom strung to the same pitch. On great feast-days one, sometimes two, guitars are added, no two instruments tuned in unison, but who can doubt that every heart beats in harmony with that of the celebrant. A short time after the Sisters' arrival (1870), at the request of the priest and the English speaking portion of the congregation, the music teacher took charge of choir and began gradually to train pupils to sing in church services, the congregation contenting itself by chiming in when one of its old-time hymns was sung. Even that died out, leaving Dona Juanita Simpson to lead a chorus when Los Americanos are not in the church. Preparations are being made for a Christmas Tree. It is to be in the select schoolroom. I notice that two of our Italian musicians are active in seeing that the tree is well loaded, and I further remark that only the resident pupils and Sisters will share from the tree. I'm only glancing over occurrences. By another year I shall have things clear in my mind. Some of our Eastern showmen, say Barnum of New York, or Robinson of Cincinnati, could make an addition to their curios if they so desired. Witness this feat in our unprovided gymnasium. After this, never I say \"crazy as a bd bg .\" We go to the table, seat ourselves as comfortably as the long benches will permit, begin a nice chat on the rare atmosphere, white clouds and ether blue; in lieu of having changed yesterday's menu from bread, meat and water to water, meat and bread. While our spirits clash with our wits, a number of knowing odoriferous acrobats let themselves drop from the rafter on to our midday spread. Their knowledge in mind reading is great everything is left for them to eat!!! To exclude these celebrated chinchi, we are going to change our dining room. Menu will be on the same lines. But our chef thinks we may soon expect a change. January 10, 1873 I know, dear Sister Justina, you would undoubtedly be very much pleased had you my pupils. You would have abundance of material for evolution. I have always given you credit for evolving the best from any character, not only morally, but intellectually as well. I doubt if the ages of my pupils would be as satisfactory to you, the majority are older than myself, and some tower fifteen inches above my head. To-day my capacity for controlling them was put to the test. You know I'm a companion outside of the schoolroom, and a teacher the instant the threshold of the schoolroom is crossed. Felipe Gurulé, son of a wealthy Mexican and a natural leader, said to the older pupils this morning: \"Oiga muchachos listen, boys, at the 10 o'clock recess when Sister calls class, do not file in, just to see what the little lady will do.\" He spoke in Spanish and thought I did not understand him. Previous to ringing the recess bell, I called the young man and told him to remain in the room, as I wished to speak to him. When the room was vacated, I asked him to throw windows and doors open for ventilation. Having done so, he took his seat, waiting to hear what I had to say. I went to my desk, scribbled a few notes, then rang the bell for second school session; the pupils, not having a leader \"Just to see what the little lady will do\" filed in as usual. There was suppressed mirth, but nothing obstreperous. When the pupils were seated, I called Felipé and asked if he would not like a few moments' airing. He smiled and went out. At the noon dismissal, he returned and asked, \"Sister, did you understand what I said to the boys this morning?\" I answered that I did. \"Then you speak Spanish?\" \"You may judge when a chance offers,\" I replied. The afternoon session was a revelation to me, every-one was so attentive and so pleased. I wonder what the next attempt on the teacher will be for boys will be boys all the world over. A worried mother came to me to-day. \"Sister, I have three boys men, all of them. I heard them say they want to come to your school. I'm afraid to let ‘Dwarf’ come. John and Jeff are all right, but ‘Dwarf’ fights worse than a bulldog when you try to take meat from it.\" \"Send them and do not worry,\" I told her. John and Jeff came to school. No teacher could desire better behaved pupils, nor any more anxious to learn. The worried mother was afraid to let \"Dwarf\" come. John spoke to me of \"Dwarf\" and said, \"If he comes it will take my mind off my studies, because I will have to watch that he does not get into a fight or break some of the school rules. Yet I wish he would come. I never heard him express a wish to be with any teacher before.\" \"Bring him, John, and before he comes mention the few rules. ‘No tobacco to be used in or around the school premises; no vulgarity in word or action.’ These two rules ought not to deter anyone anxious to study from coming to school.\" \"Dwarf\" came. John watched him as closely as an eagle does its prey. Two weeks have passed since \"Dwarf\" made his appearance. Behavior good. February 5 This day will be memorable for the pupils of Public School No 1. Jefferson came to my desk at recess time; he wanted to speak to me. \"Well, Jefferson, what do you wish to say?\" I asked. \"Sister, I want to study your religion.\" \"There are a number of things you would have to do which might not be to your liking,\" I remarked. \"Name one of the things, Sister.\" \"Confession.\" \"That means to tell everything wrong I do?\" \"It means that, with a plus and plus.\" \"What is the first plus?\" \"To be sorry you did wrong.\" \"And the second?\" \"To resolve not to do that wrong again.\" \"Dwarf,\" standing at the schoolroom door, looked at us both, his eyes flashing anger. He came toward Jefferson, raised his fist and hit him on his left jaw. I felt certain the jaw was broken. Jefferson looked at me, my eyes said, \"Keep still.\" \"Dwarf\" expected Jefferson to jump at him, and stood at defense. I broke the silence by addressing Jefferson, and said \"I'll put arnica on your face, Jefferson, and meanwhile, take your seat.\" A number of pupils anticipating trouble quietly gathered near the schoolroom door to witness the scene which they expected to take place. Every instant was a psychological one. The pupils intent in protecting the teacher against an infuriated human being who stood with blazing eyes and ready arms, waiting an onslaught on him from somewhere, but ready to annihilate anyone who would dare touch him. Jefferson went to his seat. I looked at the clock and said, \"Recess time is up,\" and rang the bell. \"Dwarf\" was nonplussed. He looked dejected; followed me to the door, took his place in the ranks and came in with his classmates, went to his seat and stared at me with wondering eyes. After attending to Jefferson, I took my seat at the desk and motioned to \"Dwarf\" to come to me. He came instantly and blurted out: \"Jeff told you I was chewing tobacco, didn't he?\" \"No, you were not mentioned. Jefferson was pleading with me to let him study my religion.\" \"Dwarf\" stood amazed. The bulldog had become a lamb. I continued in low tones: \"Suppose you were speaking to me of something of interest to you, and Jefferson entered the room and hit you in the jaw with all his strength, what ought I to do to Jefferson?\" \"Give him a sound thrashing to make him remember he made a fool of himself,\" he replied. \"I like your sense of justice,\" I remarked. \"Shall I get a switch?\" he asked. While he went out for something to have himself chastised, his brother John came to my desk. \"Sister, I'm afraid ‘Dwarf’ will do something unexpected, but I'll be at your side in one bounce.\" \"Thank you, but take your seat.\" \"Dwarf\" came in with a strong branch of cotton-wood tree. Without one word from me he gave me his right hand, then his left. Did he feel what I felt? I do not know. I hoped he would remain after morning session to have a little talk with me, but he did not, nor did he return this afternoon, from which I infer his school days are over, as far as this school is concerned. I intend to follow him up at his home and help his mother as best I can to make a better boy of him. Was this not using psychic knowledge to some purpose? February 19 This noon a number of the young men pupils came slowly into the school hall. The look on their faces puzzled me, so I walked to the front door. I ought to tell you, the road from the Convent to the end of the Public School building, one block, is used as a play-ground for the boys; the girls use the ground at the rear of the school. The look of the pupils made me fear some mischief was on hand. As soon as I reached the door facing the street, a man holding a child by each hand came toward me. \"Sister, I want to tell you, your pupils are not kind to my boys. I brought them here to play, and your pupils walked away.\" I felt sorry for the two poor innocent lads, so only said, \"Put at least a small shirt on each of them and bring them at playtime.\" The man's eyes and mouth opened wide, then he said, \"Ah, I see, I will put a camisa on them.\" February 23 Organized a Vigilant Club among the most earnest pupils. The object of this club is to report to me any case of distress in families or individuals. We are to have fun, too, but all leading to self-improvement. Clubs must have some object. This club is to meet conditions as we find them here, and improve them when possible. Oh, the immense field of work there is in this place! I've not mentioned the location of Trinidad and its consequent results. It is the rendezvous for the outlawed, who take to the Santa Fé Trail, and an equal protector for those who use the \"Statute of Limitation\" from the Territory of New Mexico. The boundary line between Colorado and New Mexico is just twelve miles from Trinidad. The spot is marked by a large stone, a few rods from which is the toll gate kept by Mr Dick Wooten, one of the first trappers of these regions. Mr Wooten's home is a refuge for all sorts of characters who can hold themselves in check while under his roof.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | S1019-D006 | 0.061 | 0.099 | 0.840 |  0.9981 |\n",
       "| 5 |  March 1, 1873. My Dear Sister Justina: It is some time since I jotted down anything in my journal. The fact is, so many incidents followed one another that it is difficult for me to note even the ones most out of the ordinary. To-day Sister Marcella and myself were at choir rehearsal when one of our native boys came in to say quite enthusiastically for a Mexican: \"Hay muchas hermanas y gentes.\" (There are many Sisters and people). And he added in English: \"And Bishop Salpointe, and priests, and mules, and wagons, all in the corral!\" This from the speaker who was anxious to have courtesy shown the travelers. Let me remark that every Spaniard or Mexican I've met has an innate refinement. Sister Marcella sent me to see to the travelers for, so we surmised, they were. When I got to the corral, I saw a medley crowd sure enough of holy men and women, and a very unholy sight of wagons, mules, and shabbily appareled, dusty and tired travelers. I took in the situation at a glance. Among the groups waiting some recognition I noticed a number of Sisters toward whom I made my way, and only succeeded in saying, \"You are welcome, Sisters,\" when one of them fairly lifted me off my feet. When she let me down, I raised my eyes to look at her she is quite tall wondering if I knew her. At first glance my wonder ceased. It was Sister Martha from the convent of my Kansas City adventure! The travelers remained with us five days. They were on their way to Arizona. Our Sisters here are, as elsewhere, most hospitable. What time I could give from my school work, I gave to our visitors. Three of these Sisters were at the Kansas City Convent, where, it will be recalled, by an accident to the train ahead of us, I had been obliged to stop off, and I had gone to their convent to await the arrival of the next train. From these Sisters I learned why I was suspected of being an impostor. A few weeks before my arrival, two men had made a wager. One man asserted that he could gain admittance to the convent after closing hour, the other positively denying that he could do so. The former, to prove his assertion, dressed in woman's clothes, applied to the convent for a night's lodging, \"I have no money, I am hungry, please give me something to eat and shelter for the night.\" The pseudo-woman was served supper, at which time the preconcerted signal was given in proof that he had gained entrance. He gave a shrill whistle and rushed from the Convent. The Sisters hardly had had time to get over their fright when I made my appearance. This accounts for the many questions put to me. Yet the unique part of the whole proceeding was that every question I answered was my own condemnation. \"Do your Sisters travel alone?\" \"No, Sister.\" \"Why are you alone?\" \"Because I was sent alone.\" \"Your letter of Obedience?\" \"I destroyed it before starting on this journey.\" Under these conditions, who would not have been suspicious of me, and who would not have taken the precaution to watch my every act? Sister Martha then told me that, with all appearances against me, the Sisters had been sympathetic. They had felt an uneasiness of mind during all the hours I was compelled to wait for the outgoing train. Good Friday, 1873. Sisters Marcella, Fidelis, and myself went to the Sierra one of the Rocky Mountain spurs to see the Penitentes make the \"Way to Calvary.\" About one hundred took part in it. They walked in twos, faces covered, backs bared. Each had several branches of long bruised cacti, with which they lashed their backs as they slowly ascended the spur. At each lash they said, \"Yo penitente pecador,\" (I, a repentant sinner.) When the one dragging the cross reached the summit of the spur, some of the penitentes helped to raise the cross he alone had dragged. It seemed impossible for any one man to have accomplished such an act, but we saw him do it. We were several miles from Trinidad and wanted to reach our convent home before the lighter of our globe threw his golden rays to warn us that he soon would retire. Easter Sunday, 1873. I must tell you what information I received concerning the Penitentes. The Way of the Cross, of course, was taught the natives by the good Franciscans; so also penance was preached to them. When the Franciscans were obliged to leave the Southwest, it naturally fell to the stronger-minded and piously inclined to perpetuate what had been taught them, but in this teaching each leader followed his own idea; hence, we find that whilst the members of some lodges are perfectly docile to the teachings of the Church, other lodges have not the least conception of the correct spirit of Catholicity, though they consider themselves good Catholics. The Penitentes in this vicinity do not even make their Easter duty. They do not scruple to abstract cattle from another man's ranch on the Easter Monday, after having scourged themselves on Good Friday and called themselves \"Repentant sinners.\" This reminds one of the private interpretation of the Bible. The Penitentes interpret the teaching of the Franciscans in their own way. The initiation to these lodges varies also. Here is one form: Ridges are made from neck to waist-line with sharp stones. By privilege I was allowed to visit one of their lodges it was literally bespattered with blood side, walls, and ceiling, too yet the members of the lodge I visited are adroit pilferers of any branded domestic animals seen on the plains. These same members never approach the Sacraments. They are condemned by the Church. Easter week Here is a tragedy which took place this week. An elderly lady and gentleman Americans residing a few miles from Trinidad, were found murdered in their home. Suspicion at once pointed to the natives as the perpetrators of the horrible deed. Small groups of men were sent out to capture the murderers. One posse trailed four Mexicans, and because they would not acknowledge the deed, were hanged on the first tree to which they came. Afterwards the corpses were huddled into a wagon, brought to Trinidad in triumph and thrown into an old vacant adobe hut, twelve feet from the graveyard near the Convent. Can you imagine how we felt! Two days later the real murderers were captured and confessed the crime. They were outlawed Americans! Rafael, Indian Chief of the Utes, is on the warpath because the government agents have repeatedly made his tribe \"move on.\" Poor Indians! Will they ever understand that the conquerors claim the land? How quickly the Indian detects true sympathy from the counterfeit! Feast of St Aloysius, 1873. The resident students were to have a free day and enjoy it on the mountains. The pastor's new white Maria (a white covered wagon) and traveling horses had been put at the Sisters' disposal. The driver that was to take the reins came at the last moment 9 o'clock A M, to say he found it impossible to go to the mountains for the day. The young ladies were woefully disappointed. Singularly for me, I did not offer to drive. Sister Marcella said: \"Sister Blandina, unless you take the young ladies to the mountains, they will have a second disappointment. Sister Eulalia can remain with them while you come back for the second load.\" So I started with the first load. The horses had been resting for two weeks and stable-fed during that time. They were horses accustomed to traveling forty or fifty miles a day to and from the various mission posts, consequently use horse sense when they start on their mission journey by not tiring themselves out at the start. When I had driven about six miles, we came to an enticing place to camp for the day. The young girls in great glee jumped to the ground. Keeping the youngest pupil to return with me, I reined the horses' heads toward Trinidad, when lo! I saw at once we had a runaway team. I recalled many horse traits so managed to guide and keep them on the road. Presently I saw our way lay through a very rough road where I had all I could do when driving out to keep clear of large boulders. So I tried my strength against the runaway horses. The reins were new and cut my hands to the bone. The atmosphere here is so clear one can see a great distance ahead, and I saw death if I kept on the road, so I gathered strength by will power and turned the horses to the left of the road on to level ground followed by a ravine. What happened I do not know, but when I awoke I saw the bus turned over, the horses grazing at a distance, the top of the bus about five rods from it, and no sign of my companion. I felt no pain, so I tried to raise the bus one ton needless to say, it did not budge. I began to search for my companion. I could see her nowhere. I went toward the white canopy of the wagon and there, under its shade, was Miss Chené, blood oozing from her nose and no sign of life. I raised her in my arms and said: \"Blessed Mother, you know I had no desire to come out here to-day. I did so through obedience. So, please, see to the life of this child, while I go for the horses.\" When I got to where the horses were grazing I picked up the reins, but horselike they understood they had the best of me, and though I said, \"Get up,\" they did not move; so I changed my system with all the energy I could and repeated, \"Get up!\" They trotted to the place of the upset bus where I tied them to one of the wheels and returned to where I had left my companion in apparent death. She was sitting up and greeted me by saying, \"Oh, Sister, there is blood all over your neck.\" Remember there was not a house in sight, nor any water. Guided by her voice, I wiped my neck and asked her if she could walk. She attempted to get up, but could not. I tried to raise her in order to carry her, but she was as heavy to me as a mountain. So we talked for a while, then attempted to walk to Trinidad. We had walked about half a mile when we saw a country wagon advancing toward us. We knew at once that whoever was in the wagon was coming to our relief. I felt no pain until I knew help was near. The instant I realized the situation, and that the burden would be shared by others, I simply collapsed. It was sheer exercise of will which prevented me from fainting. We were assisted into the wagon and started for Trinidad. On the last descent we met one of the best horsemen in these parts. He said he could see from his ranch that some accident had taken place, so he came with rope and hammer, etc, to be of some service. I remarked, \"As good a horseman as you are, you cannot trust that team.\" He smiled incredulously, but he had a runaway when he attempted to drive to town. He took a jockey's precaution tired the horses before he again turned their heads toward Trinidad. When the pastor met me, he remarked: \"I did not anticipate any trouble with you at the reins.\" I responded: \"Were I to drive that team again, I would surely tire it in sand before trusting it on any road.\" Within the next week, when the Rev gentleman was answering a sick call, the horses started on a gallop which he could not check. When the horses recognized they were the masters, they started at full speed. He was thrown out and was picked up wounded, and had to be brought into Trinidad in someone else's vehicle, leaving his own for repairs. When he came to the convent to have his wounds dressed, he remarked, \"Those horses gave me the surprise of my life no wonder, Sister, you could not hold them in.\" So St Aloysius day, 1873, will not soon be forgotten by me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | S1019-D007 | 0.071 | 0.081 | 0.848 |  0.9670 |\n",
       "| 6 |  July, 1873. Dear Sister Justina: The last time I wrote in this journal I gave you an account of what occurred on St Aloysius day. All intervals of this journal are overcrowded with events not of daily occurrence in the United States. I will note incidents which intimately concern our life work. I've discovered that the wild lemetes make a nice syrup jelly, so we shall have syrup jelly next year added to our ordinary menu. Nearly every housewife in Trinidad has come to the convent to verify the syrup fact. August: Sister Eulalia and myself strolled up the Purgatoire River looking for wild flowers. We found plenty, and also a cluster of wild plum trees plums as delicious as any cultivated plums. The land is \"virgin\" and can be made to yield fruits and vegetables pleasing to the best of agriculturists. Another Indian scare is on. This will stop land-grabbers for a while. Here any dishonest man can become possessor of the acres he covets. It has repeatedly happened that when a land-grabber nails a small house on land acquired by spurious methods, and a grabber more greedy than himself claims this theft, the result is a fight, whoever kills the other, holds possession. Such disturbances are of frequent occurrence; they cause a sensation for a few days, then all is forgotten. But the Mexican cannot forget that all his earthly possessions have gone into the hands of strangers. Woe to the poor native if he attempts to retaliate! He has no rights that the invading fortune hunters feel obliged to respect. Many of our Mexicans hold lands by traditional possession of Mercedes (Grants) and believe they are secure. The land-sharper comes in and proves their claim is not legal. No matter that they have lived on the land for years, the Mexicans must \"vamoos,\" as these corrupters of the Spanish language say. Upon a less legal tenure than the one the Mexican was made to move, the grabber takes possession. The crisis comes when one despoiler is overreached by another artful shark who, during the dark hours of the night, removes the hastily constructed lumber shanty and replaces it by one of his own, having previously torn out any county records which could prove possession. At the dawn of the next day appear on the coveted land the violators of \"Thou shalt not steal,\" ready for what may happen. The usual outcome is that one rogue recognizes the other, and each knows he has but one chance for life, who will shoot first. The last of this series of crimes is: a disappointed, dejected, would-be-rich-quick man trying to drown his disappointment in aqua fortis. Just such a man straggling along the street saw one of our quiet, honest men coming toward him. Was it the sight of goodness that aroused his infernal hatred? Without a word he drew his revolver and shot him. The victim could only say, \"Lord, have mercy on me,\" and expired. This murder aroused the indignation of every citizen. Several men who witnessed the deed caught the murderer and held him till the sheriff came. A mob gathered, and in short time the murderer was condemned to be hanged to a tree near the river, in sight of my schoolroom! The sheriff sent a messenger to ask if I wished to speak to the criminal, with the hope of making him realize the gravity of his crime and that in a few minutes he was to answer to Almighty God for the life of an innocent man. I could not see that my going to the place of retribution would bring good results, consequently, I sent a member of our Vigilant Club to try to induce the criminal to make an act of contrition, but the poor man did not comprehend, or possibly did not wish to, for he said: \"I die game! This is not the first man I made eat the earth. I die game!\" No one except those that have witnessed such a scene can imagine its horror. The hanging was done in broad daylight and as orderly as a funeral train! I mentioned in the first pages of this journal that any prisoner can burrow out of our adobe jail, and since the circuit court comes only at long intervals, it happens that no criminals are ever put on the docket. I visit the jail regularly. And here is how I am able to do it: I offer to be chaperon to the young ladies of the Academy, as most of them love open air and take horse rides on the plains, and so it requires more than ordinary sights to shock or unnerve them. Hence, in our walks, I invariably visit the prisoners. It does both the prisoners and the young ladies good. Among the group that is very fond of fresh air is a Miss C . She has read books of the ex-nun type and the horrors of what they say takes place in Convents. Consequently, she is suspicious and watches the nuns closely. Last Sunday Miss C was so homesick she actually cried out loud. Sister Eulalia was \"Angel\" at the time, and came to ask me if I could not devise something to make Miss Annie forget her homesickness. I went at once to the recreation hall and found the girl sobbing. I said: \"Come, young ladies, let us take a stroll to Simpson's Rest.\" The seniors in my class have made a trail to the top of the \"Rest.\" Miss Annie brightened up at once and said: \"Yes, girls, let's go.\" We started. After crossing the little stream called a river, we had everything to ourselves. The canopy above the plain below, leading to the base of Simpson's Spur. Miss C asked why this spur of the Rockies was named Simpson's Rest. I was glad of anything that would divert her mind, so I narrated what Mr Simpson himself had told me. \"I went on the spur,\" Mr Simpson said, \"to get away from an attack of Indians. I wanted to draw their attention to me so that the few men and women in Trinidad would have time to make preparation for defense. The ruse succeeded, the squad of Indians followed me. I knew every inch of the land, and the shortest cut to the vantage spot, where I could snap off anyone coming to the top of the spur. Two Indians tried to come, and I shot each one in turn. The others of the group so I surmised would make me die of thirst. My provisions were giving out, but the Indians held to their purpose, possibly thinking if they got rid of me, they could make a raid on Trinidad. Meanwhile, the inhabitants had brought as much water as they could store, killed two steers and dried the meat in the sun. In fact, were prepared for a siege. But, apparently, I was the one wanted. Day after day passed. The besiegers did not attempt to ascend to the place of my captivity. I had to hoard my ammunition. I was getting unbearably thirsty when suddenly I recalled a natural cut on the left of the spur where the snow never disappears. Under cover of night. I cautiously crawled to the place and found plenty of snow. I ate all I needed and took a lump with me to my hiding place. I repeated my visit to the cut for more snow. Having something to drink, I knew I could hold out indefinitely. \"At the end of a week the Indians gave the war whoop, no doubt, thinking I was dead. I felt they would climb the mountain for my scalp. Two of the most agile ran ahead of the others. I shot one and reloaded for the other, but he ran out of sight. I was worn out, for I only napped during the day and kept wide awake at night, knowing the warfare methods of the Indians. At the end of the second week I saw my besiegers gallop away, but I did not trust myself to go down to Trinidad. The watchers in Trinidad saw them depart and knew I was alive, because the Indians gave no war whoop, nor showed any scalp. So they dispatched three runners to bring me something to eat and some strong coffee. I saw them coming, and began to descend. When we met, they told me the Indians had made one raid, but were met with such a volley of shots that they did not attempt a second attack.\" George Simpson was a young man from the East. He came West as an adventurer, and became a pioneer hunter and trapper. He married a beautiful Mexican girl, Juanita, and made his home near Trinidad. The following poem written by himself some time after this adventure with the Indians, refers to her as \"one mourner\": SIMPSON'S REST Lay me to rest on you towering height, Where the silent cloud-shadows glide, Where solitude holds its slumberous reign, Far away from the human tide. I fain would sleep near the old pine tree, That looks down on the valley below, Like a soldier guarding a comrade's grave, Or a sentinel watching a foe. 'Twas a refuge once in the bygone time, When a pitiful fate was near, When my days were young and full of love For a life I held too dear. Thro' all the long years that have passed away Since those nights of storm and dread, I've prayed that the boughs that sheltered me then Might wave o'er my breast when dead. Delve deep my grave in the stern gray rock In its rigid embrace let me rest, With naught but my name on the stone And the symbol of Faith on my breast. One mourner perhaps may remember where sleeps In the rock-ribbed tomb, the lone dead, May breathe for the loved one to Heaven, a prayer, A tear to his memory shed. By the time I had narrated what had been told me, we had ascended one-half of the spur. Then Miss Annie and another girl sprang to the front and were following the trial, telling us they were not afraid of mountain cats or any other animal. \"We are ready for any adventure,\" they said. They continued following the trail until they came to a curved projection which hid me from the view of anyone coming in the opposite direction. We had been walking briskly, so no one felt like talking. The two young ladies stopped at the projection. When we reached the curve we heard men's voices. By this time I could see the quizzically amused expression on the faces of the young ladies. Meanwhile the men were saying all sorts of things to the girls while walking toward them, not suspecting the presence of anyone else. As they neared them the girls stepped backward toward us and I went in front of all my protegés. What followed was so comical, that Miss C and her companion had to sit down on the trial to get over their convulsive laughter. The instant the two (what shall I name them?) saw me, they both gave one spring toward the descent, which on their side had no trail. Realizing the law of gravity, I hid my face, believing I would have to notify their friends of their sudden death in their attempt to descend the steep side of Simpson's Rest. The laughter of the girls made me look to where the men had gone down. They had reached the bottom without injury. As soon as Miss C could speak, she changed laughter into seriousness and said: \"I want a catechism, and I want to become a Catholic. Maria Monk and Edith O'Gorman may talk and have books published against Convents but what I saw this afternoon has counteracted all I have ever read derogatory to convents and Sisters.\" Shall I add the two men came early the next day to make an apology? What does this signify? They were afraid to lose the trade of the Convent!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | S1019-D008 | 0.144 | 0.083 | 0.773 | -0.9993 |\n",

       "1  TRINIDAD On Train from Steubenville, Ohio, to Cincinnati. Nov 30, 1872. My Darling Sister Justina: How interestedly you, Sister M Louis and myself read Eugénie de Guérin's Journal and her daily anxieties to save her brother from being a spiritual outcast! This Journal which I propose keeping for you will deal with incidents occurring on my journey to Trinidad and happenings in that far-off land to which I am consigned. The Journal will begin with the first act. Here is Mother Josephine's letter: Mt St Vincent, O, Nov 27, 1872. Sister Blandina, Steubenville, O My Dear Child: You are missioned to Trinidad. You will leave Cincinnati Wednesday and alone. Mother Regina will attend to your needs. Devotedly, Mother Josephine. This letter thrilled us both. I was delighted to make the sacrifice, and you were hiding your feelings that I might not lose any merit. Neither of us could find Trinidad on the map except in the island of Cuba. So we concluded that Cuba was my destination. I was to leave Steubenville quietly so that none of my obstreperous pupils might cause the incoming teacher annoyance. Hence I went to Sunday catechetical class as usual 2:00 P M I was to take the 3:00 P M train for Cincinnati. I said to my hopefuls, \"Instead of catechism, I'm going to tell you an Indian story to-day.\" The schoolhouse roof was not disturbed, though the hurrahs were loud enough! The moral of the story was \"Indian Endurance.\" Dismissed them at two-thirty without one word of goodbye except the daily one. You remember how surprised I was to see a crowd at the station to wish me \"Godspeed\"; I thought I was to slip away without anyone's knowledge except our own. Mr Tait and Mr McCann wished to speak to me alone. Both had been in the West. \"You will have a long travel on the plains,\" they said, \"before you reach Trinidad.\" \"Where is Trinidad?\" \"A little mining town in Southwestern Colorado.\" So then I knew my destination, which, of course I would have been told at Mt St Vincent. Both gentlemen said they had traveled on the plains on the Santa Fe Trail, and they seemed to have made it a matter of conscience to inform me on the subject of cowboys. This in substance was their conversation with me: \"Sister, you may be snow-bound while on the plains.\" I looked my assent, I knew I could not stop the snow. \"Travelers are sometimes snow-bound for two weeks, and you are alone. This, though, is not the greatest danger to you.\" Mentally I was wishing both gentlemen somewhere else. \"Your real danger is from cowboys.\" I looked at the speakers. \"You do not seem to grasp our meaning. No virtuous woman is safe near a cowboy.\" Both gave up trying to make me understand what they considered danger. Why should snow or cowboys frighten me any more than others who will be traveling the same way! So you see, dearest, I'm not going to so long a distance as we thought. At three o'clock A M the baggage checker came through our coach. I looked to see how much the pocketbook contained just twenty-five cents. If I used it to ride to the Good Samaritan I'd be minus the fare to Mt St Vincent, so I made up my mind to skirt around from the Little Miami to the Good Samaritan Hospital. At four A M I rang the front doorbell no response. I sat on the stone steps and waited till I heard the rising bell, then I waited another fifteen minutes when again I rang the doorbell. Sister Anthony came. \"Why, child, where did you come from; how did you get here? I'm sure you are cold.\" I said I came from Steubenville. \"Oh, yes! dear Father Bigelow died there. He was good to this hospital. Last year he sent a barge of coal to us.\" I said he was good to anyone in need. He died possessed of three dollars and fifty cents. His hand was always open to any kind of distress. I did not mention to Sister Anthony that I walked from the Little Miami Station. After Mass, breakfast and miles of sympathy and \"God Bless You\" from the Sisters at the Good Samaritan, one of the nurses accompanied me to Fifth and Vine Streets, where I was to take \"Barney's Bus\" for Mt St Vincent. The bus was to leave at ten A M I waited till three P M then asked one of the clerks if he thought Mr McCabe would run the bus that day. \"I fear no bus will run to-day. There is an epidemic epizootic among the horses.\" I asked if Mr Segale's place of business was anywhere near. He pointed to Wood's Theater and I started to the place indicated. Brother Henry managed to find a \"hack\" to send me to Mt St Vincent. On the way, between the first ascent of the hill and the Seminary, I met Sisters Gabriella and Delphina walking in the slush and cold on their way to the Orphan Asylum. I stopped to take them in. They returned with me to Cedar Grove, from there the driver was to take them to the Asylum in Cumminsville. Sister Gabriella said to me, \"I would gladly go where you are going instead of shouldering this heavy burden.\" Sister is to be mother to three hundred orphans, taking Sister Sophia's place. The Sisters are showing great sympathy. I heard Sister Benedicta say, \"She does not mind going so far and alone I've not seen her shed a tear.\" Nor will you, my dear Sister. The tears will flow where none but He and myself will know. Still, I'm delighted to go. I did not tell you, dearest, that one year ago last November I wrote to Mother Regina saying I envied the sacrifices the Sisters were making who were sent far away to do God's work. I've received my answer with compound interest. You know that up to date the Sisters going on distant missions were consulted and none were sent who had parents living. I am pleased that that record is broken in my case. Mother Regina told me to spend a day at home. Dear Lord! Give me strength. I anticipate a scene. I spent Wednesday, December 5th, at our old homestead. Mother kept open house all day. Friends came in groups. Mr Leverone and bride, his mother and the bride's mother, Mrs Garibaldi, the Misses Gardelli and a host of others. Mrs Garibaldi threatened to take off my habit. I said, \"Hands off! Have you any right to detain Mary if John wishes to take her to California?\" \"Oh, that is different.\" \"Yes, as different as heaven and earth. I have chosen my portion, Mary has chosen hers, each abides by her choice.\" John Leverone's mother acted most sensibly all day. She was soothing oil to all the protests made to my going. Our dear mother kept quiet. When we were permitted a lone interview she asked, \"Do you want one of your sisters to accompany you?\" I answered, \"I prefer to do just as my superiors have told me.\" \"Well, then I will give you a thousand-dollar check so that in case you desire to return you will have the wherewith.\" \"No, no, dear mother, I fully realize the responsibilities I assumed. As you are aware, I realized them from the first day I entered the Novitiate.\" Mother replied: \"And I want to tell you I never doubted your vocation. I agree to your sacrifice, my dear child, keep on serving God, I will never interfere. Now that I have your explicit answer, friends cannot urge any logical reason to prevent your going.\" All day the visitors reminded me of a disturbed ant hill. When mother and I were alone she spoke the Genoese dialect. It was like hearing sketches of a favorite opera. Wednesday at 2:00 P M I went to visit our Ecclesiastical Superior. The Most Rev J B Purcell offered me several gifts. But St Francis Xavier is my patron, so I'm not going to possess any superfluous article, I only regret I could not pass our home without going in, as St Francis Xavier did. If I aim high I surely must reach some upper strata of detachment in His service. One thing I take with me, the impressive blessing given me by His Grace, part of which rings clear \"May angels guard your every step.\" He was extremely sympathetic at my having to go alone. I went to confession to Rev Dr Callaghan. You may recall how we enjoyed his lecture on the \"School Question\" delivered in Steubenville. After mother had a short interview with me, father managed to see me alone. He took hold of me and asked, \"Have I ever denied you anything?\" I signified no. \"You have never disobeyed me in your life?\" I assented. \"Now I command you you must not go on this far away mission! Are you going?\" \"Yes, father.\" He let go the hold on my arm and walked toward the door. Not without my seeing his tears falling fast. He did not realize his hold on my arm gave me pain not to speak of the heart-pain for him. In the railway station at St Louis between train time, I got off to purchase a pair of arctics. I saw several Italian women selling fruit. One of them had a daughter standing near. I asked the mother if she would permit her daughter to accompany me to the shoe store, which was in sight. The mother looked at me earnestly then said to her neighbor peddler, \"How do I know who she is, she looks like a monica (sister) but she might be a strega (witch).\" I thanked the true guardian of her daughter and went to make my purchase alone. I spoke English to the peddler. If good Sister Benedicta who thought I did not mind because I did not cry had seen me during the greater part of last night she would but too truly have said, \"That heart is human in every fiber.\" That I succeeded in dignifiedly getting away from home is Thy Grace, oh, my God! Forty-two persons accompanied me to the train, among them friends of old, but my purpose never faltered, not even in shadow. Such tactics as I executed yesterday! I see one trait strong in me, the straight service of God. Not the father whom I had never seen cry, nor the most patient, dearest mother whose heart is crushed at my being sent alone, much less the friends who used every argument to make me say I would not go could elicit the faintest trace that I was not more pleased at my going alone than if I had had a dozen with me. Sisters Antonia and Gonzaga came to the waiting room. I asked the company to permit me an interview with the Sisters. When going toward them, one of my dear old friends said, \"Look, we cannot doubt she is happy.\" This was not intended for my hearing, the noise caused the speaker to raise her voice. Sister Antonia asked me how I had spent the day. I narrated some incidents. \"I'm an ancient religious, but I could not have gone through the ordeal as creditably as you did.\" What if I had mentioned all the heart sighs I had witnessed! When it was time to board the train I asked that my last interview be with my mother. Cannot you picture her sad, endearing look of appreciation? I'll skip the last talk with mother some of it was in silence.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "2  Kansas City, Dec 6, 1872. Number one! Number two! Number three! I went toward omnibus number three. \"Any convent in this city?\" I asked. \"Yes, ma'am, step in.\" When the bus drove on the convent avenue, I saw the whole place was lighted up. I rang the doorbell and it was answered instantly. I said to the Sisters, \"Did you expect me?\" \"No, Sister.\" \"How, then, did you respond so quickly?\" \"We expected a Sister on this train. We are staying up with a dead Sister who will be buried tomorrow. In your case it is fortunate the Sister did not come you can occupy the room prepared for her the only spare room in the convent.\" Previous to this explanation, I had quickly reasoned: Superiors at home watched the papers saw the railroad accident wired the convent the result being the illumination and Sisters waiting. It did not occur to me that there might be more than one convent in Kansas City. The next turn of affairs brought me to the reality of my position. The two Sisters who had opened the door went to report the non-appearance of the one expected and my coming. Presently the Sisters returned, but their countenances had a dejected look. I became apprehensive at once and asked: \"What is it, Sisters?\" \"Our Superior wants to know if it is customary for your Sisters to travel alone?\" said one. \"No, Sister, it is not.\" \"Have you your letter of obedience?\" \"I destroyed it before starting on this journey. I have no credentials to show except the name on my wearing apparel.\" \"Why are you traveling alone?\" \"Because I was sent alone.\" With this explanation they left me to make a second report. When they returned they were more dejected than before. The elder of the two Sisters spoke: \"Sister, our Superior thinks you had better go to some hotel.\" \"Sisters, I have been well provided for my journey, but I cannot set people thinking by leaving the hospitality of a convent to seek shelter in some hotel. I clearly see I'm considered some sort of a fake, however, if you will kindly let me rest on that sofa, you can allay your fears by locking the door and taking the key with you.\" They went to make a third report. When they returned it was a pleasure to see their cheerful faces. One spoke, \"No, Sister, we are going to prepare a lunch for you.\" \"Please do not. This is the First Friday of the month and a Holy Communion day for me.\" The last vestige of doubt and fear disappeared from their countenances. A pillow and comfort were placed on the sofa and bidding me good rest, they locked the door, taking the key with them. At six o'clock A M, I was shown to the chapel. After Mass I noticed some hesistancy as how to proceed with me. Would they leave me in the convent, or have me join in the funeral procession to their graveyard? Presently I felt a light thump at the left of the priedieu on which I knelt. I looked and saw a hand holding a candle for me to take I understood I was to fall in line. After the funeral, breakfast was served me in the same room in which I had rested. About ten o'clock A M, the Superior came to interview me. I saw the handwriting on the wall, I was an impostress. Had time from interview until three o'clock to myself. During this interval I wrote. Among the jottings I wrote a letter to dear Sister Gabriella, telling her I was in a religious convent at Kansas City, but was considered some one in disguise. I told her I was glad it was I instead of Sister Justina, because her sensitiveness would make her suffer intensely. I am taking the whole incident as some of the many things that may happen to me on my journey to the Southwest. At three o'clock P M, I asked for a companion to accompany me to order the omnibus for the midnight train. After placing my order, I turned to the clerk and said, \"Be sure to send the bus.\" When I reached the exit door I returned to where the clerk was standing, and said, \"It is absolutely necessary for me to take the outgoing midnight train. Under no consideration neglect to have the omnibus come for me.\" He assured me again the order was properly placed and would be attended to. The train that brought me from St Louis had been delayed two hours, owing to the accident which had occured to the train ahead of ours. There is only one daily (nightly) train from this place to the terminus of the road. Dinner and supper were served me as breakfast had been. I am hoping that some of the Sisters will come in to relieve my mind and tell me what speices of a scarecrow I am thought to be. It is seven o'clock no one has come in so far some one now. \"You poor child! What must you think of us and the spirit of this convent?\" I did not have time to answer, for a voice called, \"Sister Martha!\" Sister Martha grasped her lighted candle and briskly followed the voice. I mentally observed that we would not carry a lighted candle through corridors and rooms. However, I have enough to think about without letting fire insurance policies annoy me. The room is dark, a reflection from a lamp-post in the street throws a small stream of light in one window. I still have fully four hours before the bus calls for me. \"Angels guard your every step.\" I'm going to rest on the sofa. I heard a voice, \"Sister?\" I sat erect. \"Mother wants to know if you are sure you ordered the bus?\" Was it my want of rest or injured feeling of pride which was on the verge of giving vent to my thoughts? From the gleam of light that came from the lamp-post I noticed that the speaker was a novice. \"Surely, Sister Blandina, you will not scandalize an aspirant in His service!\" While silently speaking thus to myself I looked at the young novice. She had a good placid face, and I said, \"Sister, please say to your Superior that I surely ordered the bus.\" She bowed and left me. Now, dearest Sister Justina, if by some unthinkable reason the omnibus does not come for me, I am positively certain the police will! \"Angels guard your every step.\" How happy I am that you, dear, are not in this predicament. I am arranging my speech to the policeman. I hear him say, \"The nuns sent for me to show you the way to any hotel you wish to go to!\" and I shall say, \"I do not wish to go to any hotel. Be kind enough to wire to the Most Rev J B Purcell, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for any information you desire about me.\" I see a note of intelligence appear on his countenance while he critically studies me but through it all I cannot see myself going to any hotel. Though the suspense of not knowing what may happen makes me uneasy. Twenty minutes after eleven I hear the patter of horses' hoofs on the convent avenue. Deo Gratias. When I realized the omnibus had come for me, I put on my wraps and with my traveling black basket walked toward the door. It was opened by a Sister in the hall. Then it was I noticed this Sister had performed the work of a sentinel, guarding me! My impulse was to brush by her and into the bus. But telepathy worked quicker than impulse. Right reason was on their side. Instant remembrance recalled the fact that a few months previous I was given charge of two dressed as Franciscan Sisters and who were making a collection in Steubenville. I was to attend to them and they were not to associate with the Sisters. The day which was to be their last with us, and when they were on their way to the station to leave the town, a policeman tapped one of the two and said, \"Both of you come with me.\" The guardian of the law had seen a big foot encased in a boot. One was a man, the other his wife, who personified Franciscan Sisters. So instead of acting by impulse, I said: \"Please, Sister, say a fervent prayer that I may reach my destination in safety.\" I saw a glistening tear of sympathy. Was I not reaping reward for suppressing a hasty impulse? Nothing noticeable took place from the time the train left Kansas City until we reached the terminus of the railroad. A few scattered frame houses and the place is called Coolage. (I am spelling this name phonetically). A train was being made up of constructive material and at the end of the train I saw a very shabby coach from the windows of which a number of men were craning their necks looking at me. Gazing in every direction, I finally saw the train conductor. I went toward him and asked if I might board the made-up train for Kit Carson. He said: \"To-morrow we will put on a day coach; this is only a construction train carrying construction material and a crowd of Irish workmen to Kit Carson.\" \"Any objection to my going with them?\" \"Not if you can put up with a working man's ‘smoker.’\" I went toward the train. The conductor assisted me into the coach. The instant the Irishmen saw a Sister their hats came off and pipes were taken out of their mouths. When seated, I said to the two men in front of me: \"Please say to these good men that I am very fond of smoke from a pipe.\" The men replaced their hats and resumed their smoking. I doubt which side was more pleased they, to have me, or I to be with them. We reached Kit Carson shortly after midnight. When \"End of Construction line\" was called, one of the men stepped over to me and offered to carry my basket. I handed it to him; then, a gentleman bowed and gave me a letter. The one who had my basket waited to see what would happen. I read the letter and saw by its contents I was to follow the giver of the letter. Thanking the courtesy of the first man I let myself be guided by the second. This was Mr Mullen, an agent of Otero and Seller, the greatest commission firm of the Southwest. The loaded caravans of this firm are constantly on the Santa Fe Trail. My instructions from Mother Regina are: \"Wait in Kit Carson until the Sisters from Trinidad come for you.\" The letter handed me is from Sister Marcella, in charge of the Trinidad School Mission. It says, \"Take the stage and come on to Trinidad.\" Kit Carson, Colorado, Dec 8, 1872 This is the feast of the Immaculate Conception, and the anniversary of making our vows. I wonder what you are doing, dear Sister Justina, while I am trying to solve the problem of either going or staying here to-day. The facts are these: Had I not been compelled to wait over twenty-two hours in Kansas City, I should have arrived here in time to take the stage that would have brought me into Trinidad on the morning of the Feast of the Immaculata. Mother Regina's instruction ceases with the new order. Only exceptionally do we travel on Sundays and feast days of obligation, so I will order the stage for to-morrow and begin a little catechetical missionary work to-day. No better feast could inaugurate my new life. When I said Grace before breakfast, I noticed how gravely the junior Mullen looked at me; which gives me the best guarantee he hasn't been taught his prayers. I asked Mrs Mullen if she had any objection to my taking James on the plains to watch the habits of the prairie dogs. She said, \"I am glad to have him go, but prairie dogs have queer habits, they cannot be caught unless they are cornered in a place where they have no burrows.\" So Jamie and myself started to watch the prairie dogs. The little midgets remained on their artificial mounds until we got quite near them, then barked their peculiar baby bark, when, with a still more singular wheezy bark, turned and bounded into their subterranean houses. Shall we ever learn the language of the lower animals! It was very plain we could not catch any of the little creatures, so I turned my attention to my young companion. \"Can you bless yourself?\" \"Like you did at breakfast?\" \"Exactly.\" \"Daddy said I ought to know how to do what you did.\" \"Shall I teach you?\" \"Oh! good, I will surprise daddy!\" I began with the Sign of the Cross. He learned quickly. I repeated the first part of the Lord's Prayer by periods many times. Then played catcher and tried again to run down a prairie dog. The little fellow was more anxious to learn than to play; which pleased me very much. By the time we went in to dinner, he had passably memorized the Lord's Prayer, Hail Mary and Grace before and after meals, so at dinner he silently said Grace with me. Mrs Mullen told me that three ladies had called to see me and would return this afternoon. We had buffalo meat for dinner. While on the train from Coolage (Colidge) to Kit Carson we saw a herd of buffalo. The herd was on a stampede. The brutes did look crazy; plainly, whatever direction they made for, nothing could stop them. Someone on the train remarked that it was surprising to see a herd of buffalo, as Kit Carson and Dick Wooten (both frontier trappers) had declared there were no more buffalo in herds. One might see a small group here and there on the plains, but a herd of buffalo was out of the question. Yet we saw one. The three ladies called again. They were anxious to be sympathetic at my traveling alone and so young! But they soon convinced themselves I needed no sympathy in my prospective workThe stage will call for me in the morning. I was told I am the only passenger booked for to-morrow. Mrs Mullen is having clean hay ready to put in the coach. I expected there would be others in the stagecoach with me. \"Angels guard your footsteps.\" \n",
       "3  Trinidad, December 10, 1872. My dearest dear: Here I am safe in Trinidad, Colorado Territory, instead of in the island of Cuba where we first thought I was to go. No wonder this small pebble (Trinidad, Colo) is not on our maps. \"Angels guide your footsteps.\" This sentence has stayed with me from the time I left the Archbishop's residence in Cincinnati, and is with me still. In Kit Carson I ordered the stage for the morning of the 9th Mrs Mullen was very attentive. She had new clean hay put in the stage to keep my feet warm, and after I got in she wrapped a large comfort around me, remarking that \"traveling on the plains and in winter was not a pleasant prospect.\" The driver must have had strict injunctions from Otero and Seller they own the stage line. For the first time I had indefinable fears. The cowboys were constantly in my mind. I expected there would be a number traveling with me on the plains. \"Snow-bound and cowboys\" came in thought to annoy me. At noon the driver came to the stage door and said: \"We take dinner here.\" I thanked him and said: \"I do not wish any dinner.\" \"But, lady, we will not have another stopping place to eat until six o'clock this evening.\" I thanked him again, \"but I do not wish any dinner.\" The jolting of the stage and my thoughts had taken all appetite away. Though I could see nothing from the stage, (every flap was fastened) it seemed that the driver aimed to drive over every stone and make the wheels go into every rut. It was nothing but a jerk up and down all the way in a stage that had no springs and traveling at the rate of twelve miles an hour! At six o'clock we arrived at the station for supper. At every station the mules were changed. The driver came to ask me to supper. I thanked him, but said: \"I do not wish any supper.\" \"There will not be another chance for a meal until twelve o'clock to-night, and you have not tasted anything to-day, so come now and take it if only a cup of black coffee.\" \"No, thank you, I have no desire for anything.\" The poor man was quite distressed. He could not think I was trying to save traveling expenses, because the price of stage traveling included meals. Here is the mental attitude I was in: If the driver could surmise the vague fear that is preying on me he would know I have no appetite. He went in to supper and presently returned. \"Lady, if you do not want to eat come in and let me have my supper. The woman who runs this station will not give me a drink of muddy water unless I fetch you in to supper I told her how you are dressed and she goes off wild and says: ‘Bring her in or you will get nothing to eat to-night, nor any other time you come.’\" I went into an adobe, log-raftered, mud-floored, mud-plastered hut. The sight of the red checkered table cloth and black coffee only added to my repugnance for food. The person who kept the station was an Irish woman of the good old stamp. I made an effort to sip some coffee, but not a drop would pass my lips. The cowboys were in my mind. I tried to ascertain if there were any in the vicinity, the answers I received were indefinite. At midnight: \"Now, lady, you will have a good meal.\" \"No, thank you, I desire nothing.\" \"What will Otero and Seller say to me when they find out you did not take a meal during this journey? They gave me more orders about you than I ever got since I'm staging, and that's ten years.\" \"Say I wished for nothing. I will write the firm my thanks.\" Oh, the lonely, fearful feeling! The night was dark. No passengers to allay my turbulent thoughts. Foot-steps drew near the stage. My heart was thumping. The driver opened the stage door and said: \"You will have a traveling companion for some miles.\" In the open door, by the light of the lantern, I saw a tall, lanky, hoosier-like man, wearing a broad brimmed hat. On one arm he had a buffalo robe. While I sat riveted, he got in asked me if I would take part of his \"kivver,\" and before my fright permitted me to speak, he placed part of the buffalo robe over the comfort that enwrapped me, and sat beside me on the rear seat. The driver closed the door and we were in utter darkness. By descriptions I had read I knew he was a cowboy! With crushing vividness \"No virtuous woman is safe near a cowboy\" came to me. I made an act of contrition concentrated my thoughts on the presence of God thought of the Archbishop's blessing, \"Angels guard your steps,\" and moved to such position as would put my heart in range with his revolver. I expected he would speak I answer he fire. The agony endured cannot be written. The silence and suspense unimaginable. Suddenly from out the darkness I heard: \"Madam!\" \"Sir!\" \"What kind of a lady be you?\" \"A Sister of Charity.\" \"Whose sister?\" \"Everyone's Sister, a person who gives her life to do good to others.\" \"Quaker like, I reckon?\" \"No, not quite.\" By this time I learned from his tone of voice that I had nothing to fear. He asked me a number of questions, all prompted by a conversation he had had with the driver before he came into the stage. In my turn I asked him why he became a cowboy. He said he had read of cowboys and ran away from home to become one. \"Is your mother still living?\" \"Yes, I allow she is leastwise she was when I left home six years ago. \"Have you written to her?\" \"No, madam, and I allow that's beastly.\" \"It is certainly unkind to one whom you can always trust and who, I am sure, loves you as much now as she did when you were a little fellow.\" His voice got husky. \"What do you say I otter do?\" \"Write; do so as soon as you get off this stage. Tell her you will soon make her a visit, and see to it that you keep your word.\" \"I will, so help me God! I was mighty feared to speak to you when I got in, because the mule driver said you was more particular than any lady he ever seen. I allow I am powerful glad I spoke to you.\" To think that this lubberly, good-natured cowboy had made me undergo such mortal anguish. He got off on the outskirts of Trinidad where the driver stopped to point out to me dugouts at the side of the foothills. \"This, lady, is Trinidad.\" A fainting feeling came over me as I looked at what I would have thought were kennels for dogs. Then I remembered my perfect health, the many years in the order of nature, before my call would come. While these thoughts were dominating, bright and vivid came to my vision the life of St Francis Xavier, farther away, in a more desolate country, with less companions, and yet who did more for God? Though I know the driver continued to talk, I do not recall a word he said. There on the outskirts facing the dugouts of Trinidad I took St Francis Xavier as my model in the missionary life. The stage stopped to throw off the mail. While so doing, a gentleman, wearing a Roman collar and having a clerical look, came to the stage door and said: \"Ya, ya, Sister, come out. This is the Convent,\" pointing to a store, which, at a glance I could see was being used for post-office and general store. He made a motion to help me out. I put my hands in my habit sleeves and sat upright in the stage, acknowledging his proffered courtesy by \"Thank you, I'll stay here.\" The gentleman's eyes twinkled merrily and he walked briskly away. A few minutes after the driver came out, took the reins and drove off. Another stopping place. The driver opened the door and said: \"Here we are.\" Before making any attempt to leave the stage, I looked at the house and in the recess of the door saw two of our Sisters. I thought, this is more like it, and was helped in by Sisters Marcella and Fidelis. The gentleman who had come to the stage door is the parish priest who wanted to see as he expressed it \"what kind of a Sister is she who was sent across the plains alone.\" He wanted to give an agreeable surprise by playing a joke. Before the stage reached the convent, he managed to say to the Sisters: \"You cannot play jokes on her.\" To-day is Mother Regina's birthday, and my first day West. I will continue this journal and some years hence send it to you, dear Sister Justina. I'm not to go in school until the 6th of January, 1873. I began to review my Spanish. Rev P J Munnecum, the parish priest, is the teacher. To my surprise, the Sisters do not speak Spanish. My previous study of the language is a great help to me and has created a desire in the Sisters to study the language also. December 14, 1872 I am sure, dearest Sister Justina, you will be interested in my viewpoint of things as I find them here. To-day I went to look at my schoolroom to be; 40 ft long; 14 ft wide; 8 ft high; two small windows, lowsized door, no transom; solid adobe walls on two sides, log rafters as black as ebony. Of necessity ventilation said \"Goodbye\" when the house was completed. But I must add all these adobe houses were built with a view to protect the inhabitants in case of a sudden attack from the warring Indians. That does not mean that every house has these dimensions. The head of each family built to suit his taste in the matter of length, breadth, and height but material to date is unchangeable: sunburnt mud (shaped, of course) 4×9×18 inches; the foundation the same as walls, mud roof over rafters mud floors. There are some seventyfive of these houses on \"Mexican Hill.\" That will be my first objective point; the second will be the jail. The Purgatoire River corrupted into Picatwar, but the natives kept its correct name, Purgatorio is below the acequia, (artificial canal) which is the boundary line to land and house given by Mr Filippe Baca, one of the leading citizens here, to the Sisters for a school. The land on which the Academy is built (now in course of erection) was donated by a Mr Heone, who lives a few miles outside of Trinidad. This gentleman and Dr Beshoar, our physician, have pews in the church if you can call eight planks nailed together, pews. The Sisters use the choir loft. The church is an adobe structure with a pretense of a gable roof and a double pretense of having been shingled; mud floor, mud walls, wooden candlesticks. Previous to the Sisters coming, bottles were used for candlesticks. The only restful spot about the church are the grounds to the entrance of it. The graveyard is in the rear of the church with a street between graveyard and convent. There is a long stretch of an adobe wall from convent (academy) to public school, the only one here and taught by the Sisters. I am told there is an Academy (called \"Rice\") maintained by the Methodists. We have twelve resident young ladies at the Academy, occupying the part that is built; very few in the select school. The Sisters are: Sister Marcella, in charge and music teacher; Sister Martha, Housekeeper; Sister Eulalia, Factotum; Sister Fidelis, Select School; Sister Blandina, Public School Teacher; Sister Eulalia, Assistant. Here is the Trinidad of today: Commercial Street, a few scattered houses the length of two blocks. Main Street, a few scattered stores occupying one side of the street about the same length as Commercial Street. Convent Street, we use to the end of the Public School grounds, where there are a few small adobe huts. So far, Mr Baca has the only house that looks like a residence. Then there is the Mexican settlement on the hill. I am informed that very few prisoners ever come to trial. They manage to burrow out from jail before the Circuit Court convenes. The Circuit Court comes from Denver. Here, if you have a largeness of vision, you find the opportunity to exercise it; if a cramped one, the immense expanse of the plains, the solid Rockies, the purity of the atmosphere, the faultlessness of the canopy above, will stretch the mind toward the Good. Maybe, dearest, it may please you to know my own attitude at the present writing. Vede mio cuore. (Look at my heart). I wish I had many hands and feet, and a world full of hearts to place at the service of the Eternal. So much one sees to be done, and so few to do it. I have adopted this plan: Do whatever presents itself, and never omit anything because of hardship or repugnance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "4  December 21. Rumor is loud in predicting an attack from the Ute tribe. We have a girl at the Academy named Ida Chené, whose mother gave me a vivid account of a sudden attack from one of the roving wild Indian tribes. The purpose of the attack was to drive out all who were not Mexicans this tribe had allied itself with the Mexicans. The outbreak took place near Taos. Mrs Chené was in the field plowing when the macheté was raised over her head and she was asked to pronounce the word juangoche. She did so to the satisfaction of the attacking group, who galloped away either to cleave or scalp the next who could not pronounce the word correctly. It is singular that not any of these things can cause me to fear. We have our own chapel. Very few Catholic Americans in Trinidad. The Church on Sunday is crowded by our native population, who come from many directions. Vehicles of every description bring the devout. Not a native woman wears any other covering on head except a mantella or shawl, and they kneel on the bare floor, and, let me add, they know how to pray and do it. In our well-to-do churches East, to secure musical harmony, professors and trained singers are engaged; in the congregations of mediocre wealth, the best talent give their service, attend rehearsals and sing when required. Yet in both elements there is a constant friction, if not always expressed, a felt dissatisfaction, and it is frequently a subject of annoyance to the Catholic conscience as to whether or not the duty of assisting at Mass is complied with by the choir attendants. The congregation, from youth to age, is ever ready to criticise the director, organist, individual singers, and choir. In the combined action of choir and congregation, how much intrinsic honor is rendered to God! He, alone, is the Judge. Now bring your attention to a close view of a scene in this church. The performers are two greyhaired men, each holding a large violin. The instrument reclines against the left knee, which is in position to rise when the signal is given that Mass has begun; right knee bent to the ground, eyes closed and head inclined. The priest begins, Et introibo, etc The violin players, with voice and instrument, strike off a half-singing, half reciting Kyrie, etc The violins seldom strung to the same pitch. On great feast-days one, sometimes two, guitars are added, no two instruments tuned in unison, but who can doubt that every heart beats in harmony with that of the celebrant. A short time after the Sisters' arrival (1870), at the request of the priest and the English speaking portion of the congregation, the music teacher took charge of choir and began gradually to train pupils to sing in church services, the congregation contenting itself by chiming in when one of its old-time hymns was sung. Even that died out, leaving Dona Juanita Simpson to lead a chorus when Los Americanos are not in the church. Preparations are being made for a Christmas Tree. It is to be in the select schoolroom. I notice that two of our Italian musicians are active in seeing that the tree is well loaded, and I further remark that only the resident pupils and Sisters will share from the tree. I'm only glancing over occurrences. By another year I shall have things clear in my mind. Some of our Eastern showmen, say Barnum of New York, or Robinson of Cincinnati, could make an addition to their curios if they so desired. Witness this feat in our unprovided gymnasium. After this, never I say \"crazy as a bd bg .\" We go to the table, seat ourselves as comfortably as the long benches will permit, begin a nice chat on the rare atmosphere, white clouds and ether blue; in lieu of having changed yesterday's menu from bread, meat and water to water, meat and bread. While our spirits clash with our wits, a number of knowing odoriferous acrobats let themselves drop from the rafter on to our midday spread. Their knowledge in mind reading is great everything is left for them to eat!!! To exclude these celebrated chinchi, we are going to change our dining room. Menu will be on the same lines. But our chef thinks we may soon expect a change. January 10, 1873 I know, dear Sister Justina, you would undoubtedly be very much pleased had you my pupils. You would have abundance of material for evolution. I have always given you credit for evolving the best from any character, not only morally, but intellectually as well. I doubt if the ages of my pupils would be as satisfactory to you, the majority are older than myself, and some tower fifteen inches above my head. To-day my capacity for controlling them was put to the test. You know I'm a companion outside of the schoolroom, and a teacher the instant the threshold of the schoolroom is crossed. Felipe Gurulé, son of a wealthy Mexican and a natural leader, said to the older pupils this morning: \"Oiga muchachos listen, boys, at the 10 o'clock recess when Sister calls class, do not file in, just to see what the little lady will do.\" He spoke in Spanish and thought I did not understand him. Previous to ringing the recess bell, I called the young man and told him to remain in the room, as I wished to speak to him. When the room was vacated, I asked him to throw windows and doors open for ventilation. Having done so, he took his seat, waiting to hear what I had to say. I went to my desk, scribbled a few notes, then rang the bell for second school session; the pupils, not having a leader \"Just to see what the little lady will do\" filed in as usual. There was suppressed mirth, but nothing obstreperous. When the pupils were seated, I called Felipé and asked if he would not like a few moments' airing. He smiled and went out. At the noon dismissal, he returned and asked, \"Sister, did you understand what I said to the boys this morning?\" I answered that I did. \"Then you speak Spanish?\" \"You may judge when a chance offers,\" I replied. The afternoon session was a revelation to me, every-one was so attentive and so pleased. I wonder what the next attempt on the teacher will be for boys will be boys all the world over. A worried mother came to me to-day. \"Sister, I have three boys men, all of them. I heard them say they want to come to your school. I'm afraid to let ‘Dwarf’ come. John and Jeff are all right, but ‘Dwarf’ fights worse than a bulldog when you try to take meat from it.\" \"Send them and do not worry,\" I told her. John and Jeff came to school. No teacher could desire better behaved pupils, nor any more anxious to learn. The worried mother was afraid to let \"Dwarf\" come. John spoke to me of \"Dwarf\" and said, \"If he comes it will take my mind off my studies, because I will have to watch that he does not get into a fight or break some of the school rules. Yet I wish he would come. I never heard him express a wish to be with any teacher before.\" \"Bring him, John, and before he comes mention the few rules. ‘No tobacco to be used in or around the school premises; no vulgarity in word or action.’ These two rules ought not to deter anyone anxious to study from coming to school.\" \"Dwarf\" came. John watched him as closely as an eagle does its prey. Two weeks have passed since \"Dwarf\" made his appearance. Behavior good. February 5 This day will be memorable for the pupils of Public School No 1. Jefferson came to my desk at recess time; he wanted to speak to me. \"Well, Jefferson, what do you wish to say?\" I asked. \"Sister, I want to study your religion.\" \"There are a number of things you would have to do which might not be to your liking,\" I remarked. \"Name one of the things, Sister.\" \"Confession.\" \"That means to tell everything wrong I do?\" \"It means that, with a plus and plus.\" \"What is the first plus?\" \"To be sorry you did wrong.\" \"And the second?\" \"To resolve not to do that wrong again.\" \"Dwarf,\" standing at the schoolroom door, looked at us both, his eyes flashing anger. He came toward Jefferson, raised his fist and hit him on his left jaw. I felt certain the jaw was broken. Jefferson looked at me, my eyes said, \"Keep still.\" \"Dwarf\" expected Jefferson to jump at him, and stood at defense. I broke the silence by addressing Jefferson, and said \"I'll put arnica on your face, Jefferson, and meanwhile, take your seat.\" A number of pupils anticipating trouble quietly gathered near the schoolroom door to witness the scene which they expected to take place. Every instant was a psychological one. The pupils intent in protecting the teacher against an infuriated human being who stood with blazing eyes and ready arms, waiting an onslaught on him from somewhere, but ready to annihilate anyone who would dare touch him. Jefferson went to his seat. I looked at the clock and said, \"Recess time is up,\" and rang the bell. \"Dwarf\" was nonplussed. He looked dejected; followed me to the door, took his place in the ranks and came in with his classmates, went to his seat and stared at me with wondering eyes. After attending to Jefferson, I took my seat at the desk and motioned to \"Dwarf\" to come to me. He came instantly and blurted out: \"Jeff told you I was chewing tobacco, didn't he?\" \"No, you were not mentioned. Jefferson was pleading with me to let him study my religion.\" \"Dwarf\" stood amazed. The bulldog had become a lamb. I continued in low tones: \"Suppose you were speaking to me of something of interest to you, and Jefferson entered the room and hit you in the jaw with all his strength, what ought I to do to Jefferson?\" \"Give him a sound thrashing to make him remember he made a fool of himself,\" he replied. \"I like your sense of justice,\" I remarked. \"Shall I get a switch?\" he asked. While he went out for something to have himself chastised, his brother John came to my desk. \"Sister, I'm afraid ‘Dwarf’ will do something unexpected, but I'll be at your side in one bounce.\" \"Thank you, but take your seat.\" \"Dwarf\" came in with a strong branch of cotton-wood tree. Without one word from me he gave me his right hand, then his left. Did he feel what I felt? I do not know. I hoped he would remain after morning session to have a little talk with me, but he did not, nor did he return this afternoon, from which I infer his school days are over, as far as this school is concerned. I intend to follow him up at his home and help his mother as best I can to make a better boy of him. Was this not using psychic knowledge to some purpose? February 19 This noon a number of the young men pupils came slowly into the school hall. The look on their faces puzzled me, so I walked to the front door. I ought to tell you, the road from the Convent to the end of the Public School building, one block, is used as a play-ground for the boys; the girls use the ground at the rear of the school. The look of the pupils made me fear some mischief was on hand. As soon as I reached the door facing the street, a man holding a child by each hand came toward me. \"Sister, I want to tell you, your pupils are not kind to my boys. I brought them here to play, and your pupils walked away.\" I felt sorry for the two poor innocent lads, so only said, \"Put at least a small shirt on each of them and bring them at playtime.\" The man's eyes and mouth opened wide, then he said, \"Ah, I see, I will put a camisa on them.\" February 23 Organized a Vigilant Club among the most earnest pupils. The object of this club is to report to me any case of distress in families or individuals. We are to have fun, too, but all leading to self-improvement. Clubs must have some object. This club is to meet conditions as we find them here, and improve them when possible. Oh, the immense field of work there is in this place! I've not mentioned the location of Trinidad and its consequent results. It is the rendezvous for the outlawed, who take to the Santa Fé Trail, and an equal protector for those who use the \"Statute of Limitation\" from the Territory of New Mexico. The boundary line between Colorado and New Mexico is just twelve miles from Trinidad. The spot is marked by a large stone, a few rods from which is the toll gate kept by Mr Dick Wooten, one of the first trappers of these regions. Mr Wooten's home is a refuge for all sorts of characters who can hold themselves in check while under his roof.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "5  March 1, 1873. My Dear Sister Justina: It is some time since I jotted down anything in my journal. The fact is, so many incidents followed one another that it is difficult for me to note even the ones most out of the ordinary. To-day Sister Marcella and myself were at choir rehearsal when one of our native boys came in to say quite enthusiastically for a Mexican: \"Hay muchas hermanas y gentes.\" (There are many Sisters and people). And he added in English: \"And Bishop Salpointe, and priests, and mules, and wagons, all in the corral!\" This from the speaker who was anxious to have courtesy shown the travelers. Let me remark that every Spaniard or Mexican I've met has an innate refinement. Sister Marcella sent me to see to the travelers for, so we surmised, they were. When I got to the corral, I saw a medley crowd sure enough of holy men and women, and a very unholy sight of wagons, mules, and shabbily appareled, dusty and tired travelers. I took in the situation at a glance. Among the groups waiting some recognition I noticed a number of Sisters toward whom I made my way, and only succeeded in saying, \"You are welcome, Sisters,\" when one of them fairly lifted me off my feet. When she let me down, I raised my eyes to look at her she is quite tall wondering if I knew her. At first glance my wonder ceased. It was Sister Martha from the convent of my Kansas City adventure! The travelers remained with us five days. They were on their way to Arizona. Our Sisters here are, as elsewhere, most hospitable. What time I could give from my school work, I gave to our visitors. Three of these Sisters were at the Kansas City Convent, where, it will be recalled, by an accident to the train ahead of us, I had been obliged to stop off, and I had gone to their convent to await the arrival of the next train. From these Sisters I learned why I was suspected of being an impostor. A few weeks before my arrival, two men had made a wager. One man asserted that he could gain admittance to the convent after closing hour, the other positively denying that he could do so. The former, to prove his assertion, dressed in woman's clothes, applied to the convent for a night's lodging, \"I have no money, I am hungry, please give me something to eat and shelter for the night.\" The pseudo-woman was served supper, at which time the preconcerted signal was given in proof that he had gained entrance. He gave a shrill whistle and rushed from the Convent. The Sisters hardly had had time to get over their fright when I made my appearance. This accounts for the many questions put to me. Yet the unique part of the whole proceeding was that every question I answered was my own condemnation. \"Do your Sisters travel alone?\" \"No, Sister.\" \"Why are you alone?\" \"Because I was sent alone.\" \"Your letter of Obedience?\" \"I destroyed it before starting on this journey.\" Under these conditions, who would not have been suspicious of me, and who would not have taken the precaution to watch my every act? Sister Martha then told me that, with all appearances against me, the Sisters had been sympathetic. They had felt an uneasiness of mind during all the hours I was compelled to wait for the outgoing train. Good Friday, 1873. Sisters Marcella, Fidelis, and myself went to the Sierra one of the Rocky Mountain spurs to see the Penitentes make the \"Way to Calvary.\" About one hundred took part in it. They walked in twos, faces covered, backs bared. Each had several branches of long bruised cacti, with which they lashed their backs as they slowly ascended the spur. At each lash they said, \"Yo penitente pecador,\" (I, a repentant sinner.) When the one dragging the cross reached the summit of the spur, some of the penitentes helped to raise the cross he alone had dragged. It seemed impossible for any one man to have accomplished such an act, but we saw him do it. We were several miles from Trinidad and wanted to reach our convent home before the lighter of our globe threw his golden rays to warn us that he soon would retire. Easter Sunday, 1873. I must tell you what information I received concerning the Penitentes. The Way of the Cross, of course, was taught the natives by the good Franciscans; so also penance was preached to them. When the Franciscans were obliged to leave the Southwest, it naturally fell to the stronger-minded and piously inclined to perpetuate what had been taught them, but in this teaching each leader followed his own idea; hence, we find that whilst the members of some lodges are perfectly docile to the teachings of the Church, other lodges have not the least conception of the correct spirit of Catholicity, though they consider themselves good Catholics. The Penitentes in this vicinity do not even make their Easter duty. They do not scruple to abstract cattle from another man's ranch on the Easter Monday, after having scourged themselves on Good Friday and called themselves \"Repentant sinners.\" This reminds one of the private interpretation of the Bible. The Penitentes interpret the teaching of the Franciscans in their own way. The initiation to these lodges varies also. Here is one form: Ridges are made from neck to waist-line with sharp stones. By privilege I was allowed to visit one of their lodges it was literally bespattered with blood side, walls, and ceiling, too yet the members of the lodge I visited are adroit pilferers of any branded domestic animals seen on the plains. These same members never approach the Sacraments. They are condemned by the Church. Easter week Here is a tragedy which took place this week. An elderly lady and gentleman Americans residing a few miles from Trinidad, were found murdered in their home. Suspicion at once pointed to the natives as the perpetrators of the horrible deed. Small groups of men were sent out to capture the murderers. One posse trailed four Mexicans, and because they would not acknowledge the deed, were hanged on the first tree to which they came. Afterwards the corpses were huddled into a wagon, brought to Trinidad in triumph and thrown into an old vacant adobe hut, twelve feet from the graveyard near the Convent. Can you imagine how we felt! Two days later the real murderers were captured and confessed the crime. They were outlawed Americans! Rafael, Indian Chief of the Utes, is on the warpath because the government agents have repeatedly made his tribe \"move on.\" Poor Indians! Will they ever understand that the conquerors claim the land? How quickly the Indian detects true sympathy from the counterfeit! Feast of St Aloysius, 1873. The resident students were to have a free day and enjoy it on the mountains. The pastor's new white Maria (a white covered wagon) and traveling horses had been put at the Sisters' disposal. The driver that was to take the reins came at the last moment 9 o'clock A M, to say he found it impossible to go to the mountains for the day. The young ladies were woefully disappointed. Singularly for me, I did not offer to drive. Sister Marcella said: \"Sister Blandina, unless you take the young ladies to the mountains, they will have a second disappointment. Sister Eulalia can remain with them while you come back for the second load.\" So I started with the first load. The horses had been resting for two weeks and stable-fed during that time. They were horses accustomed to traveling forty or fifty miles a day to and from the various mission posts, consequently use horse sense when they start on their mission journey by not tiring themselves out at the start. When I had driven about six miles, we came to an enticing place to camp for the day. The young girls in great glee jumped to the ground. Keeping the youngest pupil to return with me, I reined the horses' heads toward Trinidad, when lo! I saw at once we had a runaway team. I recalled many horse traits so managed to guide and keep them on the road. Presently I saw our way lay through a very rough road where I had all I could do when driving out to keep clear of large boulders. So I tried my strength against the runaway horses. The reins were new and cut my hands to the bone. The atmosphere here is so clear one can see a great distance ahead, and I saw death if I kept on the road, so I gathered strength by will power and turned the horses to the left of the road on to level ground followed by a ravine. What happened I do not know, but when I awoke I saw the bus turned over, the horses grazing at a distance, the top of the bus about five rods from it, and no sign of my companion. I felt no pain, so I tried to raise the bus one ton needless to say, it did not budge. I began to search for my companion. I could see her nowhere. I went toward the white canopy of the wagon and there, under its shade, was Miss Chené, blood oozing from her nose and no sign of life. I raised her in my arms and said: \"Blessed Mother, you know I had no desire to come out here to-day. I did so through obedience. So, please, see to the life of this child, while I go for the horses.\" When I got to where the horses were grazing I picked up the reins, but horselike they understood they had the best of me, and though I said, \"Get up,\" they did not move; so I changed my system with all the energy I could and repeated, \"Get up!\" They trotted to the place of the upset bus where I tied them to one of the wheels and returned to where I had left my companion in apparent death. She was sitting up and greeted me by saying, \"Oh, Sister, there is blood all over your neck.\" Remember there was not a house in sight, nor any water. Guided by her voice, I wiped my neck and asked her if she could walk. She attempted to get up, but could not. I tried to raise her in order to carry her, but she was as heavy to me as a mountain. So we talked for a while, then attempted to walk to Trinidad. We had walked about half a mile when we saw a country wagon advancing toward us. We knew at once that whoever was in the wagon was coming to our relief. I felt no pain until I knew help was near. The instant I realized the situation, and that the burden would be shared by others, I simply collapsed. It was sheer exercise of will which prevented me from fainting. We were assisted into the wagon and started for Trinidad. On the last descent we met one of the best horsemen in these parts. He said he could see from his ranch that some accident had taken place, so he came with rope and hammer, etc, to be of some service. I remarked, \"As good a horseman as you are, you cannot trust that team.\" He smiled incredulously, but he had a runaway when he attempted to drive to town. He took a jockey's precaution tired the horses before he again turned their heads toward Trinidad. When the pastor met me, he remarked: \"I did not anticipate any trouble with you at the reins.\" I responded: \"Were I to drive that team again, I would surely tire it in sand before trusting it on any road.\" Within the next week, when the Rev gentleman was answering a sick call, the horses started on a gallop which he could not check. When the horses recognized they were the masters, they started at full speed. He was thrown out and was picked up wounded, and had to be brought into Trinidad in someone else's vehicle, leaving his own for repairs. When he came to the convent to have his wounds dressed, he remarked, \"Those horses gave me the surprise of my life no wonder, Sister, you could not hold them in.\" So St Aloysius day, 1873, will not soon be forgotten by me.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "6  July, 1873. Dear Sister Justina: The last time I wrote in this journal I gave you an account of what occurred on St Aloysius day. All intervals of this journal are overcrowded with events not of daily occurrence in the United States. I will note incidents which intimately concern our life work. I've discovered that the wild lemetes make a nice syrup jelly, so we shall have syrup jelly next year added to our ordinary menu. Nearly every housewife in Trinidad has come to the convent to verify the syrup fact. August: Sister Eulalia and myself strolled up the Purgatoire River looking for wild flowers. We found plenty, and also a cluster of wild plum trees plums as delicious as any cultivated plums. The land is \"virgin\" and can be made to yield fruits and vegetables pleasing to the best of agriculturists. Another Indian scare is on. This will stop land-grabbers for a while. Here any dishonest man can become possessor of the acres he covets. It has repeatedly happened that when a land-grabber nails a small house on land acquired by spurious methods, and a grabber more greedy than himself claims this theft, the result is a fight, whoever kills the other, holds possession. Such disturbances are of frequent occurrence; they cause a sensation for a few days, then all is forgotten. But the Mexican cannot forget that all his earthly possessions have gone into the hands of strangers. Woe to the poor native if he attempts to retaliate! He has no rights that the invading fortune hunters feel obliged to respect. Many of our Mexicans hold lands by traditional possession of Mercedes (Grants) and believe they are secure. The land-sharper comes in and proves their claim is not legal. No matter that they have lived on the land for years, the Mexicans must \"vamoos,\" as these corrupters of the Spanish language say. Upon a less legal tenure than the one the Mexican was made to move, the grabber takes possession. The crisis comes when one despoiler is overreached by another artful shark who, during the dark hours of the night, removes the hastily constructed lumber shanty and replaces it by one of his own, having previously torn out any county records which could prove possession. At the dawn of the next day appear on the coveted land the violators of \"Thou shalt not steal,\" ready for what may happen. The usual outcome is that one rogue recognizes the other, and each knows he has but one chance for life, who will shoot first. The last of this series of crimes is: a disappointed, dejected, would-be-rich-quick man trying to drown his disappointment in aqua fortis. Just such a man straggling along the street saw one of our quiet, honest men coming toward him. Was it the sight of goodness that aroused his infernal hatred? Without a word he drew his revolver and shot him. The victim could only say, \"Lord, have mercy on me,\" and expired. This murder aroused the indignation of every citizen. Several men who witnessed the deed caught the murderer and held him till the sheriff came. A mob gathered, and in short time the murderer was condemned to be hanged to a tree near the river, in sight of my schoolroom! The sheriff sent a messenger to ask if I wished to speak to the criminal, with the hope of making him realize the gravity of his crime and that in a few minutes he was to answer to Almighty God for the life of an innocent man. I could not see that my going to the place of retribution would bring good results, consequently, I sent a member of our Vigilant Club to try to induce the criminal to make an act of contrition, but the poor man did not comprehend, or possibly did not wish to, for he said: \"I die game! This is not the first man I made eat the earth. I die game!\" No one except those that have witnessed such a scene can imagine its horror. The hanging was done in broad daylight and as orderly as a funeral train! I mentioned in the first pages of this journal that any prisoner can burrow out of our adobe jail, and since the circuit court comes only at long intervals, it happens that no criminals are ever put on the docket. I visit the jail regularly. And here is how I am able to do it: I offer to be chaperon to the young ladies of the Academy, as most of them love open air and take horse rides on the plains, and so it requires more than ordinary sights to shock or unnerve them. Hence, in our walks, I invariably visit the prisoners. It does both the prisoners and the young ladies good. Among the group that is very fond of fresh air is a Miss C . She has read books of the ex-nun type and the horrors of what they say takes place in Convents. Consequently, she is suspicious and watches the nuns closely. Last Sunday Miss C was so homesick she actually cried out loud. Sister Eulalia was \"Angel\" at the time, and came to ask me if I could not devise something to make Miss Annie forget her homesickness. I went at once to the recreation hall and found the girl sobbing. I said: \"Come, young ladies, let us take a stroll to Simpson's Rest.\" The seniors in my class have made a trail to the top of the \"Rest.\" Miss Annie brightened up at once and said: \"Yes, girls, let's go.\" We started. After crossing the little stream called a river, we had everything to ourselves. The canopy above the plain below, leading to the base of Simpson's Spur. Miss C asked why this spur of the Rockies was named Simpson's Rest. I was glad of anything that would divert her mind, so I narrated what Mr Simpson himself had told me. \"I went on the spur,\" Mr Simpson said, \"to get away from an attack of Indians. I wanted to draw their attention to me so that the few men and women in Trinidad would have time to make preparation for defense. The ruse succeeded, the squad of Indians followed me. I knew every inch of the land, and the shortest cut to the vantage spot, where I could snap off anyone coming to the top of the spur. Two Indians tried to come, and I shot each one in turn. The others of the group so I surmised would make me die of thirst. My provisions were giving out, but the Indians held to their purpose, possibly thinking if they got rid of me, they could make a raid on Trinidad. Meanwhile, the inhabitants had brought as much water as they could store, killed two steers and dried the meat in the sun. In fact, were prepared for a siege. But, apparently, I was the one wanted. Day after day passed. The besiegers did not attempt to ascend to the place of my captivity. I had to hoard my ammunition. I was getting unbearably thirsty when suddenly I recalled a natural cut on the left of the spur where the snow never disappears. Under cover of night. I cautiously crawled to the place and found plenty of snow. I ate all I needed and took a lump with me to my hiding place. I repeated my visit to the cut for more snow. Having something to drink, I knew I could hold out indefinitely. \"At the end of a week the Indians gave the war whoop, no doubt, thinking I was dead. I felt they would climb the mountain for my scalp. Two of the most agile ran ahead of the others. I shot one and reloaded for the other, but he ran out of sight. I was worn out, for I only napped during the day and kept wide awake at night, knowing the warfare methods of the Indians. At the end of the second week I saw my besiegers gallop away, but I did not trust myself to go down to Trinidad. The watchers in Trinidad saw them depart and knew I was alive, because the Indians gave no war whoop, nor showed any scalp. So they dispatched three runners to bring me something to eat and some strong coffee. I saw them coming, and began to descend. When we met, they told me the Indians had made one raid, but were met with such a volley of shots that they did not attempt a second attack.\" George Simpson was a young man from the East. He came West as an adventurer, and became a pioneer hunter and trapper. He married a beautiful Mexican girl, Juanita, and made his home near Trinidad. The following poem written by himself some time after this adventure with the Indians, refers to her as \"one mourner\": SIMPSON'S REST Lay me to rest on you towering height, Where the silent cloud-shadows glide, Where solitude holds its slumberous reign, Far away from the human tide. I fain would sleep near the old pine tree, That looks down on the valley below, Like a soldier guarding a comrade's grave, Or a sentinel watching a foe. 'Twas a refuge once in the bygone time, When a pitiful fate was near, When my days were young and full of love For a life I held too dear. Thro' all the long years that have passed away Since those nights of storm and dread, I've prayed that the boughs that sheltered me then Might wave o'er my breast when dead. Delve deep my grave in the stern gray rock In its rigid embrace let me rest, With naught but my name on the stone And the symbol of Faith on my breast. One mourner perhaps may remember where sleeps In the rock-ribbed tomb, the lone dead, May breathe for the loved one to Heaven, a prayer, A tear to his memory shed. By the time I had narrated what had been told me, we had ascended one-half of the spur. Then Miss Annie and another girl sprang to the front and were following the trial, telling us they were not afraid of mountain cats or any other animal. \"We are ready for any adventure,\" they said. They continued following the trail until they came to a curved projection which hid me from the view of anyone coming in the opposite direction. We had been walking briskly, so no one felt like talking. The two young ladies stopped at the projection. When we reached the curve we heard men's voices. By this time I could see the quizzically amused expression on the faces of the young ladies. Meanwhile the men were saying all sorts of things to the girls while walking toward them, not suspecting the presence of anyone else. As they neared them the girls stepped backward toward us and I went in front of all my protegés. What followed was so comical, that Miss C and her companion had to sit down on the trial to get over their convulsive laughter. The instant the two (what shall I name them?) saw me, they both gave one spring toward the descent, which on their side had no trail. Realizing the law of gravity, I hid my face, believing I would have to notify their friends of their sudden death in their attempt to descend the steep side of Simpson's Rest. The laughter of the girls made me look to where the men had gone down. They had reached the bottom without injury. As soon as Miss C could speak, she changed laughter into seriousness and said: \"I want a catechism, and I want to become a Catholic. Maria Monk and Edith O'Gorman may talk and have books published against Convents but what I saw this afternoon has counteracted all I have ever read derogatory to convents and Sisters.\" Shall I add the two men came early the next day to make an apology? What does this signify? They were afraid to lose the trade of the Convent!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

My Darling Sister Justina: How interestedly you, Sister M Louis and myself read Eugénie de Guérin's Journal and her daily anxieties to save her brother from being a spiritual outcast! This Journal which I propose keeping for you will deal with incidents occurring on my journey to Trinidad and happenings in that far-off land to which I am consigned. The Journal will begin with the first act. Here is Mother Josephine's letter: Mt St Vincent, O, Nov 27, 1872. Sister Blandina, Steubenville, O My Dear Child: You are missioned to Trinidad. You will leave Cincinnati Wednesday and alone. Mother Regina will attend to your needs. Devotedly, Mother Josephine. This letter thrilled us both. I was delighted to make the sacrifice, and you were hiding your feelings that I might not lose any merit. Neither of us could find Trinidad on the map except in the island of Cuba. So we concluded that Cuba was my destination. I was to leave Steubenville quietly so that none of my obstreperous pupils might cause the incoming teacher annoyance. Hence I went to Sunday catechetical class as usual 2:00 P M I was to take the 3:00 P M train for Cincinnati. I said to my hopefuls, \"Instead of catechism, I'm going to tell you an Indian story to-day.\" The schoolhouse roof was not disturbed, though the hurrahs were loud enough! The moral of the story was \"Indian Endurance.\" Dismissed them at two-thirty without one word of goodbye except the daily one. You remember how surprised I was to see a crowd at the station to wish me \"Godspeed\"; I thought I was to slip away without anyone's knowledge except our own. Mr Tait and Mr McCann wished to speak to me alone. Both had been in the West. \"You will have a long travel on the plains,\" they said, \"before you reach Trinidad.\" \"Where is Trinidad?\" \"A little mining town in Southwestern Colorado.\" So then I knew my destination, which, of course I would have been told at Mt St Vincent. Both gentlemen said they had traveled on the plains on the Santa Fe Trail, and they seemed to have made it a matter of conscience to inform me on the subject of cowboys. This in substance was their conversation with me: \"Sister, you may be snow-bound while on the plains.\" I looked my assent, I knew I could not stop the snow. \"Travelers are sometimes snow-bound for two weeks, and you are alone. This, though, is not the greatest danger to you.\" Mentally I was wishing both gentlemen somewhere else. \"Your real danger is from cowboys.\" I looked at the speakers. \"You do not seem to grasp our meaning. No virtuous woman is safe near a cowboy.\" Both gave up trying to make me understand what they considered danger. Why should snow or cowboys frighten me any more than others who will be traveling the same way! So you see, dearest, I'm not going to so long a distance as we thought. At three o'clock A M the baggage checker came through our coach. I looked to see how much the pocketbook contained just twenty-five cents. If I used it to ride to the Good Samaritan I'd be minus the fare to Mt St Vincent, so I made up my mind to skirt around from the Little Miami to the Good Samaritan Hospital. At four A M I rang the front doorbell no response. I sat on the stone steps and waited till I heard the rising bell, then I waited another fifteen minutes when again I rang the doorbell. Sister Anthony came. \"Why, child, where did you come from; how did you get here? I'm sure you are cold.\" I said I came from Steubenville. \"Oh, yes! dear Father Bigelow died there. He was good to this hospital. Last year he sent a barge of coal to us.\" I said he was good to anyone in need. He died possessed of three dollars and fifty cents. His hand was always open to any kind of distress. I did not mention to Sister Anthony that I walked from the Little Miami Station. After Mass, breakfast and miles of sympathy and \"God Bless You\" from the Sisters at the Good Samaritan, one of the nurses accompanied me to Fifth and Vine Streets, where I was to take \"Barney's Bus\" for Mt St Vincent. The bus was to leave at ten A M I waited till three P M then asked one of the clerks if he thought Mr McCabe would run the bus that day. \"I fear no bus will run to-day. There is an epidemic epizootic among the horses.\" I asked if Mr Segale's place of business was anywhere near. He pointed to Wood's Theater and I started to the place indicated. Brother Henry managed to find a \"hack\" to send me to Mt St Vincent. On the way, between the first ascent of the hill and the Seminary, I met Sisters Gabriella and Delphina walking in the slush and cold on their way to the Orphan Asylum. I stopped to take them in. They returned with me to Cedar Grove, from there the driver was to take them to the Asylum in Cumminsville. Sister Gabriella said to me, \"I would gladly go where you are going instead of shouldering this heavy burden.\" Sister is to be mother to three hundred orphans, taking Sister Sophia's place. The Sisters are showing great sympathy. I heard Sister Benedicta say, \"She does not mind going so far and alone I've not seen her shed a tear.\" Nor will you, my dear Sister. The tears will flow where none but He and myself will know. Still, I'm delighted to go. I did not tell you, dearest, that one year ago last November I wrote to Mother Regina saying I envied the sacrifices the Sisters were making who were sent far away to do God's work. I've received my answer with compound interest. You know that up to date the Sisters going on distant missions were consulted and none were sent who had parents living. I am pleased that that record is broken in my case. Mother Regina told me to spend a day at home. Dear Lord! Give me strength. I anticipate a scene. I spent Wednesday, December 5th, at our old homestead. Mother kept open house all day. Friends came in groups. Mr Leverone and bride, his mother and the bride's mother, Mrs Garibaldi, the Misses Gardelli and a host of others. Mrs Garibaldi threatened to take off my habit. I said, \"Hands off! Have you any right to detain Mary if John wishes to take her to California?\" \"Oh, that is different.\" \"Yes, as different as heaven and earth. I have chosen my portion, Mary has chosen hers, each abides by her choice.\" John Leverone's mother acted most sensibly all day. She was soothing oil to all the protests made to my going. Our dear mother kept quiet. When we were permitted a lone interview she asked, \"Do you want one of your sisters to accompany you?\" I answered, \"I prefer to do just as my superiors have told me.\" \"Well, then I will give you a thousand-dollar check so that in case you desire to return you will have the wherewith.\" \"No, no, dear mother, I fully realize the responsibilities I assumed. As you are aware, I realized them from the first day I entered the Novitiate.\" Mother replied: \"And I want to tell you I never doubted your vocation. I agree to your sacrifice, my dear child, keep on serving God, I will never interfere. Now that I have your explicit answer, friends cannot urge any logical reason to prevent your going.\" All day the visitors reminded me of a disturbed ant hill. When mother and I were alone she spoke the Genoese dialect. It was like hearing sketches of a favorite opera. Wednesday at 2:00 P M I went to visit our Ecclesiastical Superior. The Most Rev J B Purcell offered me several gifts. But St Francis Xavier is my patron, so I'm not going to possess any superfluous article, I only regret I could not pass our home without going in, as St Francis Xavier did. If I aim high I surely must reach some upper strata of detachment in His service. One thing I take with me, the impressive blessing given me by His Grace, part of which rings clear \"May angels guard your every step.\" He was extremely sympathetic at my having to go alone. I went to confession to Rev Dr Callaghan. You may recall how we enjoyed his lecture on the \"School Question\" delivered in Steubenville. After mother had a short interview with me, father managed to see me alone. He took hold of me and asked, \"Have I ever denied you anything?\" I signified no. \"You have never disobeyed me in your life?\" I assented. \"Now I command you you must not go on this far away mission! Are you going?\" \"Yes, father.\" He let go the hold on my arm and walked toward the door. Not without my seeing his tears falling fast. He did not realize his hold on my arm gave me pain not to speak of the heart-pain for him. In the railway station at St Louis between train time, I got off to purchase a pair of arctics. I saw several Italian women selling fruit. One of them had a daughter standing near. I asked the mother if she would permit her daughter to accompany me to the shoe store, which was in sight. The mother looked at me earnestly then said to her neighbor peddler, \"How do I know who she is, she looks like a monica (sister) but she might be a strega (witch).\" I thanked the true guardian of her daughter and went to make my purchase alone. I spoke English to the peddler. If good Sister Benedicta who thought I did not mind because I did not cry had seen me during the greater part of last night she would but too truly have said, \"That heart is human in every fiber.\" That I succeeded in dignifiedly getting away from home is Thy Grace, oh, my God! Forty-two persons accompanied me to the train, among them friends of old, but my purpose never faltered, not even in shadow. Such tactics as I executed yesterday! I see one trait strong in me, the straight service of God. Not the father whom I had never seen cry, nor the most patient, dearest mother whose heart is crushed at my being sent alone, much less the friends who used every argument to make me say I would not go could elicit the faintest trace that I was not more pleased at my going alone than if I had had a dozen with me. Sisters Antonia and Gonzaga came to the waiting room. I asked the company to permit me an interview with the Sisters. When going toward them, one of my dear old friends said, \"Look, we cannot doubt she is happy.\" This was not intended for my hearing, the noise caused the speaker to raise her voice. Sister Antonia asked me how I had spent the day. I narrated some incidents. \"I'm an ancient religious, but I could not have gone through the ordeal as creditably as you did.\" What if I had mentioned all the heart sighs I had witnessed! When it was time to board the train I asked that my last interview be with my mother. Cannot you picture her sad, endearing look of appreciation? I'll skip the last talk with mother some of it was in silence. </td></tr>\n",

       "\t1 & S1019-D002 &  TRINIDAD On Train from Steubenville, Ohio, to Cincinnati. Nov 30, 1872. My Darling Sister Justina: How interestedly you, Sister M Louis and myself read Eugénie de Guérin's Journal and her daily anxieties to save her brother from being a spiritual outcast! This Journal which I propose keeping for you will deal with incidents occurring on my journey to Trinidad and happenings in that far-off land to which I am consigned. The Journal will begin with the first act. Here is Mother Josephine's letter: Mt St Vincent, O, Nov 27, 1872. Sister Blandina, Steubenville, O My Dear Child: You are missioned to Trinidad. You will leave Cincinnati Wednesday and alone. Mother Regina will attend to your needs. Devotedly, Mother Josephine. This letter thrilled us both. I was delighted to make the sacrifice, and you were hiding your feelings that I might not lose any merit. Neither of us could find Trinidad on the map except in the island of Cuba. So we concluded that Cuba was my destination. I was to leave Steubenville quietly so that none of my obstreperous pupils might cause the incoming teacher annoyance. Hence I went to Sunday catechetical class as usual 2:00 P M I was to take the 3:00 P M train for Cincinnati. I said to my hopefuls, \"Instead of catechism, I'm going to tell you an Indian story to-day.\" The schoolhouse roof was not disturbed, though the hurrahs were loud enough! The moral of the story was \"Indian Endurance.\" Dismissed them at two-thirty without one word of goodbye except the daily one. You remember how surprised I was to see a crowd at the station to wish me \"Godspeed\"; I thought I was to slip away without anyone's knowledge except our own. Mr Tait and Mr McCann wished to speak to me alone. Both had been in the West. \"You will have a long travel on the plains,\" they said, \"before you reach Trinidad.\" \"Where is Trinidad?\" \"A little mining town in Southwestern Colorado.\" So then I knew my destination, which, of course I would have been told at Mt St Vincent. Both gentlemen said they had traveled on the plains on the Santa Fe Trail, and they seemed to have made it a matter of conscience to inform me on the subject of cowboys. This in substance was their conversation with me: \"Sister, you may be snow-bound while on the plains.\" I looked my assent, I knew I could not stop the snow. \"Travelers are sometimes snow-bound for two weeks, and you are alone. This, though, is not the greatest danger to you.\" Mentally I was wishing both gentlemen somewhere else. \"Your real danger is from cowboys.\" I looked at the speakers. \"You do not seem to grasp our meaning. No virtuous woman is safe near a cowboy.\" Both gave up trying to make me understand what they considered danger. Why should snow or cowboys frighten me any more than others who will be traveling the same way! So you see, dearest, I'm not going to so long a distance as we thought. At three o'clock A M the baggage checker came through our coach. I looked to see how much the pocketbook contained just twenty-five cents. If I used it to ride to the Good Samaritan I'd be minus the fare to Mt St Vincent, so I made up my mind to skirt around from the Little Miami to the Good Samaritan Hospital. At four A M I rang the front doorbell no response. I sat on the stone steps and waited till I heard the rising bell, then I waited another fifteen minutes when again I rang the doorbell. Sister Anthony came. \"Why, child, where did you come from; how did you get here? I'm sure you are cold.\" I said I came from Steubenville. \"Oh, yes! dear Father Bigelow died there. He was good to this hospital. Last year he sent a barge of coal to us.\" I said he was good to anyone in need. He died possessed of three dollars and fifty cents. His hand was always open to any kind of distress. I did not mention to Sister Anthony that I walked from the Little Miami Station. After Mass, breakfast and miles of sympathy and \"God Bless You\" from the Sisters at the Good Samaritan, one of the nurses accompanied me to Fifth and Vine Streets, where I was to take \"Barney's Bus\" for Mt St Vincent. The bus was to leave at ten A M I waited till three P M then asked one of the clerks if he thought Mr McCabe would run the bus that day. \"I fear no bus will run to-day. There is an epidemic epizootic among the horses.\" I asked if Mr Segale's place of business was anywhere near. He pointed to Wood's Theater and I started to the place indicated. Brother Henry managed to find a \"hack\" to send me to Mt St Vincent. On the way, between the first ascent of the hill and the Seminary, I met Sisters Gabriella and Delphina walking in the slush and cold on their way to the Orphan Asylum. I stopped to take them in. They returned with me to Cedar Grove, from there the driver was to take them to the Asylum in Cumminsville. Sister Gabriella said to me, \"I would gladly go where you are going instead of shouldering this heavy burden.\" Sister is to be mother to three hundred orphans, taking Sister Sophia's place. The Sisters are showing great sympathy. I heard Sister Benedicta say, \"She does not mind going so far and alone I've not seen her shed a tear.\" Nor will you, my dear Sister. The tears will flow where none but He and myself will know. Still, I'm delighted to go. I did not tell you, dearest, that one year ago last November I wrote to Mother Regina saying I envied the sacrifices the Sisters were making who were sent far away to do God's work.

       "1  TRINIDAD On Train from Steubenville, Ohio, to Cincinnati. Nov 30, 1872. My Darling Sister Justina: How interestedly you, Sister M Louis and myself read Eugénie de Guérin's Journal and her daily anxieties to save her brother from being a spiritual outcast! This Journal which I propose keeping for you will deal with incidents occurring on my journey to Trinidad and happenings in that far-off land to which I am consigned. The Journal will begin with the first act. Here is Mother Josephine's letter: Mt St Vincent, O, Nov 27, 1872. Sister Blandina, Steubenville, O My Dear Child: You are missioned to Trinidad. You will leave Cincinnati Wednesday and alone. Mother Regina will attend to your needs. Devotedly, Mother Josephine. This letter thrilled us both. I was delighted to make the sacrifice, and you were hiding your feelings that I might not lose any merit. Neither of us could find Trinidad on the map except in the island of Cuba. So we concluded that Cuba was my destination. I was to leave Steubenville quietly so that none of my obstreperous pupils might cause the incoming teacher annoyance. Hence I went to Sunday catechetical class as usual 2:00 P M I was to take the 3:00 P M train for Cincinnati. I said to my hopefuls, \"Instead of catechism, I'm going to tell you an Indian story to-day.\" The schoolhouse roof was not disturbed, though the hurrahs were loud enough! The moral of the story was \"Indian Endurance.\" Dismissed them at two-thirty without one word of goodbye except the daily one. You remember how surprised I was to see a crowd at the station to wish me \"Godspeed\"; I thought I was to slip away without anyone's knowledge except our own. Mr Tait and Mr McCann wished to speak to me alone. Both had been in the West. \"You will have a long travel on the plains,\" they said, \"before you reach Trinidad.\" \"Where is Trinidad?\" \"A little mining town in Southwestern Colorado.\" So then I knew my destination, which, of course I would have been told at Mt St Vincent. Both gentlemen said they had traveled on the plains on the Santa Fe Trail, and they seemed to have made it a matter of conscience to inform me on the subject of cowboys. This in substance was their conversation with me: \"Sister, you may be snow-bound while on the plains.\" I looked my assent, I knew I could not stop the snow. \"Travelers are sometimes snow-bound for two weeks, and you are alone. This, though, is not the greatest danger to you.\" Mentally I was wishing both gentlemen somewhere else. \"Your real danger is from cowboys.\" I looked at the speakers. \"You do not seem to grasp our meaning. No virtuous woman is safe near a cowboy.\" Both gave up trying to make me understand what they considered danger. Why should snow or cowboys frighten me any more than others who will be traveling the same way! So you see, dearest, I'm not going to so long a distance as we thought. At three o'clock A M the baggage checker came through our coach. I looked to see how much the pocketbook contained just twenty-five cents. If I used it to ride to the Good Samaritan I'd be minus the fare to Mt St Vincent, so I made up my mind to skirt around from the Little Miami to the Good Samaritan Hospital. At four A M I rang the front doorbell no response. I sat on the stone steps and waited till I heard the rising bell, then I waited another fifteen minutes when again I rang the doorbell. Sister Anthony came. \"Why, child, where did you come from; how did you get here? I'm sure you are cold.\" I said I came from Steubenville. \"Oh, yes! dear Father Bigelow died there. He was good to this hospital. Last year he sent a barge of coal to us.\" I said he was good to anyone in need. He died possessed of three dollars and fifty cents. His hand was always open to any kind of distress. I did not mention to Sister Anthony that I walked from the Little Miami Station. After Mass, breakfast and miles of sympathy and \"God Bless You\" from the Sisters at the Good Samaritan, one of the nurses accompanied me to Fifth and Vine Streets, where I was to take \"Barney's Bus\" for Mt St Vincent. The bus was to leave at ten A M I waited till three P M then asked one of the clerks if he thought Mr McCabe would run the bus that day. \"I fear no bus will run to-day. There is an epidemic epizootic among the horses.\" I asked if Mr Segale's place of business was anywhere near. He pointed to Wood's Theater and I started to the place indicated. Brother Henry managed to find a \"hack\" to send me to Mt St Vincent. On the way, between the first ascent of the hill and the Seminary, I met Sisters Gabriella and Delphina walking in the slush and cold on their way to the Orphan Asylum. I stopped to take them in. They returned with me to Cedar Grove, from there the driver was to take them to the Asylum in Cumminsville. Sister Gabriella said to me, \"I would gladly go where you are going instead of shouldering this heavy burden.\" Sister is to be mother to three hundred orphans, taking Sister Sophia's place. The Sisters are showing great sympathy. I heard Sister Benedicta say, \"She does not mind going so far and alone I've not seen her shed a tear.\" Nor will you, my dear Sister. The tears will flow where none but He and myself will know. Still, I'm delighted to go. I did not tell you, dearest, that one year ago last November I wrote to Mother Regina saying I envied the sacrifices the Sisters were making who were sent far away to do God's work. I've received my answer with compound interest. You know that up to date the Sisters going on distant missions were consulted and none were sent who had parents living. I am pleased that that record is broken in my case. Mother Regina told me to spend a day at home. Dear Lord! Give me strength. I anticipate a scene. I spent Wednesday, December 5th, at our old homestead. Mother kept open house all day. Friends came in groups. Mr Leverone and bride, his mother and the bride's mother, Mrs Garibaldi, the Misses Gardelli and a host of others. Mrs Garibaldi threatened to take off my habit. I said, \"Hands off! Have you any right to detain Mary if John wishes to take her to California?\" \"Oh, that is different.\" \"Yes, as different as heaven and earth. I have chosen my portion, Mary has chosen hers, each abides by her choice.\" John Leverone's mother acted most sensibly all day. She was soothing oil to all the protests made to my going. Our dear mother kept quiet. When we were permitted a lone interview she asked, \"Do you want one of your sisters to accompany you?\" I answered, \"I prefer to do just as my superiors have told me.\" \"Well, then I will give you a thousand-dollar check so that in case you desire to return you will have the wherewith.\" \"No, no, dear mother, I fully realize the responsibilities I assumed. As you are aware, I realized them from the first day I entered the Novitiate.\" Mother replied: \"And I want to tell you I never doubted your vocation. I agree to your sacrifice, my dear child, keep on serving God, I will never interfere. Now that I have your explicit answer, friends cannot urge any logical reason to prevent your going.\" All day the visitors reminded me of a disturbed ant hill. When mother and I were alone she spoke the Genoese dialect. It was like hearing sketches of a favorite opera. Wednesday at 2:00 P M I went to visit our Ecclesiastical Superior. The Most Rev J B Purcell offered me several gifts. But St Francis Xavier is my patron, so I'm not going to possess any superfluous article, I only regret I could not pass our home without going in, as St Francis Xavier did. If I aim high I surely must reach some upper strata of detachment in His service. One thing I take with me, the impressive blessing given me by His Grace, part of which rings clear \"May angels guard your every step.\" He was extremely sympathetic at my having to go alone. I went to confession to Rev Dr Callaghan. You may recall how we enjoyed his lecture on the \"School Question\" delivered in Steubenville. After mother had a short interview with me, father managed to see me alone. He took hold of me and asked, \"Have I ever denied you anything?\" I signified no. \"You have never disobeyed me in your life?\" I assented. \"Now I command you you must not go on this far away mission! Are you going?\" \"Yes, father.\" He let go the hold on my arm and walked toward the door. Not without my seeing his tears falling fast. He did not realize his hold on my arm gave me pain not to speak of the heart-pain for him. In the railway station at St Louis between train time, I got off to purchase a pair of arctics. I saw several Italian women selling fruit. One of them had a daughter standing near. I asked the mother if she would permit her daughter to accompany me to the shoe store, which was in sight. The mother looked at me earnestly then said to her neighbor peddler, \"How do I know who she is, she looks like a monica (sister) but she might be a strega (witch).\" I thanked the true guardian of her daughter and went to make my purchase alone. I spoke English to the peddler. If good Sister Benedicta who thought I did not mind because I did not cry had seen me during the greater part of last night she would but too truly have said, \"That heart is human in every fiber.\" That I succeeded in dignifiedly getting away from home is Thy Grace, oh, my God! Forty-two persons accompanied me to the train, among them friends of old, but my purpose never faltered, not even in shadow. Such tactics as I executed yesterday! I see one trait strong in me, the straight service of God. Not the father whom I had never seen cry, nor the most patient, dearest mother whose heart is crushed at my being sent alone, much less the friends who used every argument to make me say I would not go could elicit the faintest trace that I was not more pleased at my going alone than if I had had a dozen with me. Sisters Antonia and Gonzaga came to the waiting room. I asked the company to permit me an interview with the Sisters. When going toward them, one of my dear old friends said, \"Look, we cannot doubt she is happy.\" This was not intended for my hearing, the noise caused the speaker to raise her voice. Sister Antonia asked me how I had spent the day. I narrated some incidents. \"I'm an ancient religious, but I could not have gone through the ordeal as creditably as you did.\" What if I had mentioned all the heart sighs I had witnessed! When it was time to board the train I asked that my last interview be with my mother. Cannot you picture her sad, endearing look of appreciation? I'll skip the last talk with mother some of it was in silence. "
